year fishing has been a popular recreation activity for visitors here for more than years and many people come to yellowstone just to fish though angling is an anomaly in a park where the primary purpose is to preserve natural environments and native species in ways that maintain natural conditions fishing in yellowstone can help support preservation of native species authorized fishing and boating tour guides current conditions usgs links to yellowstone's stream flows jump to page section fishing regulations handling and releasing fish fish identification fishing in yellowstone if you re planning to fish while visiting yellowstone this video will provide you with the information you need to plan your fishing outing water related rules safety the hot water of yellowstone's thermal features is dangerous but far more people have been killed by exposure to the cold waters of the park's lakes and rivers birds such as loons waterfowl cranes and shorebirds are vulnerable to lead poisoning while we can do little about natural hazards we can minimize the effects of lead on these species yellowstone national park bans most lead tackle terminal tackle must be lead free large downrigger weights used to fish for deep dwelling lake trout are permissible because they are too large to be ingested anglers assist with native species conservation the activities necessary to preserve and restore native fish varies by species and drainages across the park in order to promote the preservation of native fish in yellowstone the park has designated the native trout conservation area for special management within that area fishing regulations are structured so that recreational anglers help selectively remove nonnative species from the area without damaging the native fishery in some areas anglers' harvests will help to save the native fish and the natural ecosystems they support decisions about how best to achieve native fish preservation and recovery goals must be based in sound scientific research and be consistent with the mission of the national park service most years a team of fly fishing volunteers assist the yellowstone fisheries program with several other projects including removal of non native species evaluation of fish barrier efficacy and success a study to determine injury and mortality rates when using barbed versus barbless hooks surveys to determine species composition and logistical support for large multi agency projects their extensive help collecting data and biological samples allows park biologists to learn about many more areas than park staff would have time to access volunteers interact with visitors and other fly fishers and are able to discuss important topics such as park fishing regulations the reasoning behind some of the more controversial restoration projects and why native fish are an important resource in yellowstone please don't mix information from multiple locations thank you for supporting our fisheries management program by returning these cards to park biologists sorry but there is no program for fishing regulations fishing regulations in yellowstone national park are structured to strongly support native fish conservation goals fishing angling is defined as any activity using an attended single rod or line for the purpose of attempting to attract capture or possess any fish

planner park fishing regulations are designed to protect native fish and aquatic ecosystems provide recreational opportunities and also preserve the tradition of angling in yellowstone cutthroat trout arctic grayling mountain whitefish and other native fishes are important to the ecology of yellowstone because cutthroat trout and arctic grayling inhabit relatively shallow waters many animals depend on them as a food source especially during spring when the fish spawn in small lake inlets and tributary streams angling is an important part of the park s cultural history nonnative trout are important to the angler experience in yellowstone but they contribute to the decline in the park s native cutthroat trout and arctic grayling by competing for food and habitat preying on native fish and degrading the genetic integrity of native fish by hybridizing with them yellowstone is making a substantial on the ground effort to conserve native fish in several areas these actions which are currently focused in the lamar and grayling creek drainages and yellowstone lake are described in the park s native fish conservation plan goals are to reduce the risk of extinction restore and maintain the ecological role and create sustainable angling and viewing opportunities for native fish handling releasing fish to better ensure survival of hooked fish follow these guidelines please help us maintain quality fisheries within the park for future generations to enjoy handling for all native fish and any nonnative fish you intend to release bring the fish in as quickly as possible do not play the fish to exhaustion always make sure your hands are wet if you must handle the fish dry hands damage a fish s protective mucous film hold the fish with one hand around the tail section and the other beneath the belly just behind the pectoral fins never grab or hold a fish through the gills unless it is already dead if you want a photo of the fish make sure the photographer is ready before you handle the fish make it quick unhooking unhook the fish in quiet water such as an eddy or slow spot do not drag the fish across land use forceps or small needle nosed pliers to quickly remove the hook tackle lures hooks hooks and lures typically have barbs when purchased with small pliers you must pinch down the barbs without barbs more skill is required in landing and bringing in fish but hook removal is easier and less traumatic to the fish spinning lures typically have three hooks called treble hooks with wire cutters you can snip off one of the hooks or snap one off with pliers you also must pinch down all the barbs two hooks are still effective easier to remove and less traumatic if the fish is deeply hooked cut the line do not pull out the hook most fish can survive with hooks left in exhausted fish never just throw a fish back into the water if a fish becomes passive it is probably close to exhaustion gently remove the hook within calm water then lightly cradle the fish with your hands to see what it does if it struggles to keep itself upright hold the fish around its tail and beneath its belly with its head facing upstream into the current move the fish gently back and forth toward and away from the current you should notice the gills opening and closing due to the rush of water this is like giving a fish mouth to mouth resuscitation when the fish has recovered it should swim away on its own fish and aquatic species native fish underpin natural food webs and have great local economic significance fisheries aquatic sciences program explore the national park service science program for fish and aquatic species know your fish has a slash put it back the native fish which must be released unharmed include arctic grayling cutthroat trout

stars reviews out of stars reviews out of stars reviews click here for the next set of products best line on the market this reviewer rated product out of stars a friend told me about this line and i will never use anything else the only draw back is when i am lake fishing the line does not cut thru the water as fast as mono but i will sacrifice that to never loose a fish again my wife had some mono line on her reel and it got snagged in the weeds and snap hook line sinker and bobber the next weekend we went back to the lake and we were fishing the same area and i pulled her whole set up out of the weeds without loosing a thing with my fireline this reviewer rated product out of stars read more click to read full text of review titled i found your site and i could breath a little better excellent rod and reel combo for the money this reviewer rated product out of stars read more click to read full text of review titled excellent rod and reel combo for the money have an expensive ft inch kvd tour spinning rod and t carbon reel and the mitchell is heavier but not by much so its very light and comfortable when casting all day i liked it so much i bought a second one impressive casting this reviewer rated product out of stars i bought this reel and rod combo about a month ago and it has replaced my favorite up to this point reel it is noticeable the difference between my old spinning the reel has incredible smooth and quiet motion the ball bearings provide great casting and retraction it was an impulse buy and i read reviews afterward which made me second guess but knock on wood this is my favorite reel rod combo made me a mitchell believer and customer this review was collected as part of a promotion have not used it yet sorry this reviewer rated product out of stars read more click to read full text of review titled have not used it yet sorry products off the shelf hope someone there could understand how much money could be transferred having meetings there great little reel this reviewer rated product out of stars bought this reel a few weeks ago and put it on a ' ice fishing rod for my daughter who is very pleased with this reel casts smooth light weight and easy to use she loves it great rod for a woman this reviewer rated product out of stars my wife like the action and strong back bone and the feeling of the rod can't beat it this reviewer rated product out of stars bought this rod for my girlfriend for christmas but couldn't wait we took it striper fishing just to see how it did first fish broke off using lb line but was happy to see her haul in a lb striper yesterday i am very impressed with the this rod and ugly stik as a whole will be buying there striper combos for bigger striper soon this reel works great in rain and wind too this reviewer rated product out of stars i love my ardent pro bait casting reel these reels have worked great for me in all conditions wet windy sunny and dry and hot they have not let me down while others are picking at theirs i am casting away awesome reel this reviewer rated product out of stars i personally like this reel it is smooth in operation and can cast a long distance once you have it dialed in backlashing is minimal this frog is awesome this reviewer rated product out of stars these frogs are good they walk across the water easily and before you know it a fish is hitting your lure the first day i bought the lure my first cast i hit a bass definitely catches fish this reviewer rated product out of stars i've used several frogs before but used the pad crusher for the first time yesterday and boy was i impressed a lot cheaper compared to other brands and did everything right caught a nice fatty on my rd cast and then some great for the price great lure this reviewer rated product out of stars i bought this lure a month ago and i always keep it in my tackle bag i've caught five pound bass in a day using this bait on the flats i recommend this bait great quality jig and sharpest hook this reviewer rated product out of stars used these and few other styles of the strike king trokar jigs and could not be happier great quality and components and the trokar hook is seriously the sharpest hook on the planet i just love it color everything this reviewer rated product out of stars i saw this at another place it lasted about a week and this one is brand new so i will buy it they work this reviewer rated product out of stars i was skeptical at first but i bought a pack of d bombs to see what all the fuss was about after throwing a jig beavers and pit bosses on my last scouting trip i decided to try these baits all i can say is they eat um often i'm a firm believe in the d bombs now not to mention they smell so good i want to eat them myself my only complaint is that they need to make one in a blue saphire color other than that i recommend these baits to anyone who wants to catch more fish my go to bait this reviewer rated product out of stars this is my favorite go to bait i use a weighted hook with a screw lock and texas rig it it has been working for me all the time whenever other baits are not working for me i always go to a d bomb my go to this reviewer rated product out of stars i bought these the other day and first cast i had a nice hook up the action of the tail is the best i've used great imitation and colors are amazing great versatile bait this reviewer rated product out of stars great weight and buoyancy for skipping under trees and dock also works in heavy cover or open water the action of this bait is amazing and almost effortless berst hook on market this reviewer rated product out of stars most versatile well built hook i have ever used strong perfectly waited and did i say sharp don't hesitate this reviewer rated product out of stars have been happy with costa for years but after trying these i'll never go back just wait til you see the water bead off the carl zeiss lenses great product durrable this reviewer rated product out of stars bought this to put on my toyota truck bed rail system to hold my rods instead of laying them in the bed this way i could carry rods and reels and still have the bed of the truck for other cargo i mounted of them on to the bed rail system with stainless steal bots nuts and washers without having to drill a single hole works great and looks cool great option to texas rigging this reviewer rated product out of stars these are awesome for anything plastic the swivel allows movement in current that i believe makes a difference very easy to use a little pricey though shad pole this reviewer rated product out of stars haven't had a chance to use yet but judging by the videos and the reviews is going to be awesome can't wait the go to lure this reviewer rated product out of stars i almost always start my fishing trips using the shad pole lures they work excellent for everything from crappie walleye bass and catfish if i haven't caught anything in the first half hour with this lure then the fish are probably not gonna be biting at all the lure size and rotating tail make them irresistible to hungry fish good float this reviewer rated product out of stars i bought this at the beginning of summer and have fished it hard it casts very well and is noisy with a good slurp gulp sound when the float dips under water also the small beads make a clack when worked lightly the paint has started coming off but that doesn't affect the fish i like this one more than the outcast as the leader attaches to the bottom not the same eyelet as the line makes for less tangles it's tough to see at night that's my only complaint great corks this reviewer rated product out of stars have caught alot of fish on these corks hands down best action this gloves are the best i've ever used this reviewer rated product out of stars i purchased these glove a few weeks ago they have been very useful at work and keep my hands protected these glove last longer than most gloves do i always repurchase they are the best i've recommend these gloves to my friends at work now i see these purple glove on all my gal pals at work awesome gloves this reviewer rated product out of stars my wife loves these gloves and she used them for gardening they are great for the price cach lbs bass this reviewer rated product out of stars my dad went to a turn a minute and he brought home a bunch of striking lewers i solve the recon worms and i used a texas rig and i casted out on my first gas and caught a pound bass this is a great bait i think everyone should buy it best 'big worms' on the market this reviewer rated product out of stars the action created by the rage tail is fantastic these worms are great for large bass but not too big for smaller pounders either

mathematicians summary what they do work environment how to become one pay job outlook state area data similar occupations more info summary summary master's degree none none much faster than average mathematicians conduct research to develop and understand mathematical principles they also analyze data and apply mathematical techniques to help solve real world problems mathematicians work in the federal government and in private science and engineering research companies they may work on teams with engineers scientists and other professionals mathematicians typically need at least a master s degree in mathematics however some positions are available for those with a bachelor s degree the median annual wage for mathematicians was in may employment of mathematicians is projected to grow percent from to much faster than the average for all occupations businesses will need mathematicians to analyze the increasing volume of digital and electronic data explore resources for employment and wages by state and area for mathematicians compare the job duties education job growth and pay of mathematicians with similar occupations learn more about mathematicians by visiting additional resources including o net a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations what mathematicians do mathematicians conduct research to develop and understand mathematical principles they also analyze data and apply mathematical techniques to help solve real world problems duties mathematicians typically do the following develop new mathematical rules theories and concepts in areas such as algebra and geometry use mathematical formulas and models to prove or disprove theories apply mathematical theories and techniques to solve practical problems in business engineering the sciences and other fields develop mathematical or statistical models to analyze data interpret data and report conclusions drawn from their analyses use data analysis to support and improve business decisions read professional journals talk with other mathematicians and attend professional conferences to maintain their knowledge of current trends despite the differences between applied and theoretical mathematics these areas frequently overlap many mathematicians particularly those in government or private industry will use both applied and theoretical knowledge in their job duties work environment mathematicians held about jobs in the largest employers of mathematicians were as follows federal government scientific research and development services colleges universities and professional schools state local and private finance and insurance manufacturing mathematicians typically work in offices they also may work on teams with engineers scientists and other occupations work schedules most mathematicians work full time deadlines and last minute requests for data or analysis may require overtime in addition mathematicians may have to travel to attend seminars and conferences how to become a mathematician mathematicians typically need at least a master s degree in mathematics however some positions are available for those with a bachelor s degree education in private industry mathematicians typically need an advanced degree either a master s degree or a doctorate for jobs with the federal government candidates need at least a bachelor s degree in mathematics or significant coursework in mathematics most colleges and universities offer a bachelor s degree in mathematics courses usually include calculus differential equations and linear and abstract algebra many colleges and universities advise or require mathematics students to take courses in a related field such as computer science engineering physics or statistics because mathematicians often work with data analysis software computer programming courses may be particularly beneficial for students students who are interested in becoming mathematicians should take as many math courses as possible in high school important qualities pay median annual wages may mathematicians mathematical science occupations total all occupations the median annual wage for mathematicians was in may the median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less the lowest percent earned less than and the highest percent earned more than in may the median annual wages for mathematicians in the top industries in which they worked were as follows scientific research and development services manufacturing federal government finance and insurance colleges universities and professional schools state local and private most mathematicians work full time deadlines and last minute requests for data or analysis may require overtime in addition mathematicians may travel to attend seminars and conferences job outlook percent change in employment projected mathematical science occupations mathematicians total all occupations employment of mathematicians is projected to grow percent from to much faster than the average for all occupations however because it is a small occupation the fast growth will result in only about new jobs over the year period the amount of digitally stored data will increase over the next decade as more people and companies conduct business online and use social media smartphones and other mobile devices as a result businesses

even advertise products to potential customers mathematicians also will be needed to help information security analysts create data security systems to protect confidential information of individuals and businesses job prospects because the occupation is small and there are relatively few mathematician positions strong competition for jobs is expected despite the strong competition for formal mathematician positions many candidates with a background in advanced mathematical techniques and modeling will find good job opportunities in other closely related fields those with a graduate degree

formula one premier league lawn tennis film video music environment photo video special report opinion issues lifestyle about us contact us advertise with us why study of mathematics is important waec registrar aug am education nigerian news the registrar west african examinations council waec dr iyi uwadiae says the knowledge of mathematics remained indispensable for further studies and national development uwadiae said this in his keynote address at the th annual conference of the mathematical association of nigeria man the theme of the conference is mathematics as key to sustainable change in growth and development according to him the essence of mathematics education at both the basic and senior secondary school levels includes raising individuals that will comprehend analyse synthesise evaluate and make generalisations in order to solve mathematical problems among other skills mathematics provides a powerful and universal language that is appropriate when communicating mathematics ideas reasoning and findings both orally and in writing especially in this st century the progress of a nation is measured in terms of its ability to meet the needs of its citizens every nation therefore makes concerted efforts to meet these needs in the most effective and efficient manner nigeria is a developing nation and that is why it is still grappling with poverty hunger overpopulation unemployment diseases and many others and therefore a lot needs to be done to tackle these setbacks and make it comparable with other developed nations a good foundational skill in mathematics is therefore sine qua non to improvement in the various sectors and therefore as a subject it should be given its pride of place in the school curriculum there is no doubt that education us a tool for national develooment the knowledge and skills required for such development are acquired from the carious subjects and courses studied in school the waec boss said uwaduae added that mathematics equips students with analytical and logical minds needed to learn the other subjects he said that student s achievements in mathematics enable them to develop self confidence and become self radiant it could be argued that the more self confident a student is the more easily he or she could learn any subject and the more meaningful contributions they could make to national development he said uwadiae said that mathematics was the language of science technology and engineering adding that the developments in these areas and their contributions to global development were made possible by knowledge of mathematics he noted that understanding mathematics was essential to understanding the output usually presented in the form of computer graphics and sequences of contoured fields of the basic variables thus there is need for meteorologists to have good mathematics skills as the impact of weather forecast on aviation agriculture transportation tourism and other allied sectors on national growth and development cannot be ignored schools ability to improve students basic skills in mathematics and literacy are important to economic growth students enrollment measures do not reflect how much students are learning as knowledge capital is what matters in national development and as cognitive skills are highly related to growth he said the waec boss further added that mathematics is a prerequisite for admission into tertiary institutiobs for many courses and also for effective performances in some occupations accordingcto him the majority of the candidates will not be qualified for admission into higher institution or be effective at work if such students are not encouraged and motivated to improve in their oerformances a large number of them may drop out and the desired growth and development in our nation may be difficult to achieve he said he however identified the fear of mathematics inappropriate teaching methods inadequate qualified mathematics teachers as well as inadequate infrastructure as some of the challenges militating against the development and mastry of the subject among the students uwadiae said that efforts must be made by parents guardians counsellors principals and other stakeholders to change students mindsets about mathematics being a monster subject he also said that admission of students to study mathematics at the university should be based on academic qualification instead of catchment area according to him one of the greatest tragedies of the past decades is the collapse of an education system which was founded on sound developmental goals it is imperative to address the litany of challenges of teaching and learning of mathematics in the nigerian education system the tasks ahead are numerous and daunting it is clear that it will be imposible for these radks to be tackled by government alone the involvement of major stakeholders in all sectors of the economy will be essential if the goals and potentials of nigeria are to be realised he said nan in pictures buhari departs abuja to new york for un function speed up revitalisation of ajaokuta alscon mining council urges fg lagos

mathematics standards common core state standards initiative home development process frequently asked questions myths vs facts branding guidelines contact what parents should know standards in your state english language arts standards mathematics standards key shifts in english language arts key shifts in mathematics statements of support mathematics standards for more than a decade research studies of mathematics education in high performing countries have concluded that mathematics education in the united states must become substantially more focused and coherent in order to improve mathematics achievement in this country to deliver on this promise the mathematics standards are designed to address the problem of a curriculum that is a mile wide and an inch deep these new standards build on the best of high quality math standards from states across the country they also draw on the most important international models for mathematical practice as well as research and input from numerous sources including state departments of education scholars assessment developers professional organizations educators parents and students and members of the public the math standards provide clarity and specificity rather than broad general statements they endeavor to follow the design envisioned by william schmidt and richard houang by not only stressing conceptual understanding of key ideas but also by continually returning to organizing principles such as place value and the laws of arithmetic to structure those ideas in addition the sequence of topics and performances that is outlined in a body of math standards must respect what is already known about how students learn as confrey points out developing sequenced obstacles and challenges for students absent the insights about meaning that derive from careful study of learning would be unfortunate and unwise therefore the development of the standards began with research based learning progressions detailing what is known today about how students mathematical knowledge skill and understanding develop over time the knowledge and skills students need to be prepared for mathematics in college career and life are woven throughout the mathematics standards they do not include separate anchor standards like those used in the ela literacy standards the common core concentrates on a clear set of math skills and concepts students will learn concepts in a more organized way both during the school year and across grades the standards encourage students to solve real world problems understanding mathematics these standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics but asking a student to understand something also means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it but what does mathematical understanding look like one way for teachers to do that is to ask the student to justify in a way that is appropriate to the student s mathematical maturity why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness standards for mathematical practice how to read the grade level standards introduction counting cardinality operations algebraic

application statistics faq contact us mathematics including mathematics with physics container overview mathematics at cambridge the cambridge mathematics course is often considered to be the most demanding undergraduate mathematics course available in britain and correspondingly one of the most rewarding two other aspects of the course that our students greatly appreciate are its flexibility and the breadth of subjects offered the amount of choice increases each year and after year the workload isn t fixed so you can choose the number of options you study to suit your own work pattern some students take as many options as they can others take fewer and study them very thoroughly our faculty since sir isaac newton was lucasian professor mathematics teaching and research here have been enhanced by a string of brilliant mathematicians including six fields medallists and even nobel prize winners most current faculty members are leading international authorities on their subject additional course costs changing course over the years mathematicians have changed successfully to nearly every other subject taught at cambridge however it's not advisable to apply for mathematics intending to transfer to a subject other than physics careers a cambridge mathematics degree is versatile and very marketable the demand for our mathematicians is high in business commerce and industry as well as the academic world around of our students go on to further study while others follow a wide variety of careers recent graduates include a metrologist sports statistician journalist and an avionics radar and communications engineer as well as teachers actuaries accountants it specialists financiers and consultants course outline course outline in year you typically have lectures and two supervisions each week in the following years the greater choice and flexibility means that the pattern of lectures and supervisions is more irregular but the average load is roughly the same you sit four written examination papers each year in addition there are optional computer projects in years and in the fourth year each course is examined individually and you have the option of submitting an essay on a current research topic year part ia in the first year there are two options to choose from pure and applied mathematics for students intending to continue with mathematics mathematics with physics for students who may want to study physics after the first year part ia introduces you to the fundamentals of higher mathematics including the study of algebraic systems such as groups analysis of calculus probability mathematical methods such as vector calculus newtonian dynamics and special relativity you take eight subjects those taking mathematics with physics replace two mathematics subjects with part ia physics from natural sciences covering for example kinetic theory fourier analysis and electromagnetism year part ib in part ib you choose from around options available in most the topics of the first year are studied in much greater depth but some new topics are offered for example geometry electromagnetism quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics applicable mathematics which includes statistics and optimisation a rigorous treatment of topics from decision mathematics numerical analysis there are also optional computational projects assessed by means of reports and programs submitted before the summer examinations using numerical or algebraic techniques to investigate mathematical problems year part ii year gives you the opportunity to explore your mathematical interests in detail there is a very wide choice including papers on for example cryptography algebraic topology number theory cosmology general relativity stochastic financial models waves automata and formal languages mathematical biology there are also optional computational projects year part iii optional integrated masters entry requirements typical offers require course requirements admission assessment assessment format there is no common format written assessment for mathematics applicants will continue to sit step alongside a levels colleges will assess aptitude knowledge base and potential through short tasks at the time of interview you do not need to register or be registered in advance for the assessment at interview the colleges provide details of arrangements in the letters inviting applicants to interview please note that your performance in the assessment at interview will not be considered in isolation but will be taken into account alongside the other elements of your application for mathematics candidates interviewed overseas a written maths assessment will be administered by the overseas interviewing team which will then be made available to the cambridge college along with the overseas interview report submitted work applicants are not typically asked to submit examples of written work some may be asked by their college to do some reading in advance of their interview but if this is required the college will provide full details in the letter inviting the student to interview resources faculty of mathematics explore

at cambridge underground mathematics online mathematics resources for a level students and teachers kis unistats information contextual information from september every undergraduate course of more than one year's duration will have a key information set kis the kis allows you to compare pieces of information about individual courses at different higher education institutions however please note that superficially similar courses often have very different structures and objectives and that the teaching support and learning environment that best suits you can only be determined by identifying your own interests needs expectations and goals and comparing them with detailed institution and course specific information we recommend that you look thoroughly at the course and university information contained on these webpages and consider coming to visit us on an open day rather than relying solely on statistical comparison you may find the following notes helpful when considering information presented by the kis the kis relies on superficially similar courses being coded in the same way whilst this works on one level it leads to some anomalies for example music courses and music technology courses can have exactly the same code despite being very different programmes with quite distinct educational and career outcomes any course which combines several disciplines as many courses at cambridge do tends to be compared nationally with courses in just one of those disciplines and in such cases a kis comparison may not be an accurate or fair reflection of the reality of either for example you may find that when considering a degree which embraces a range of disciplines such as biology physics chemistry and geology for instance natural sciences at cambridge the comparison provided is with courses at other institutions that primarily focus on just one or a smaller combination of those subjects whilst the kis makes reference to some broad types of financial support offered by institutions it cannot compare packages offered by different institutions different students have different circumstances and requirements and you should weigh up what matters to you most level of fee fee waivers means tested support such as bursaries non means tested support such as academic scholarships and study grants and living costs such as accommodation travel the kis provides a typical cost of private ie non university accommodation this is very difficult to estimate as prices and properties vary university accommodation can be substantially cheaper and if you are likely to live in college for much or all of the duration of your course as is the case at cambridge then the cost of private accommodation will be of less or no relevance for you the kis also provides the typical annual cost of university accommodation and the number of beds available note that since most universities offer a range of residential accommodation you should check with institutions about the likelihood of securing a room at a price that suits your budget knowing the number of beds available is not necessarily useful it may be much more important to find out if all students are guaranteed accommodation time in lectures seminars and similar can vary enormously by institution depending on the structure of the course and the quality of such contact time should be the primary consideration whilst starting salaries can be a useful measure they do not give any sense of career trajectory or take account of the voluntary low paid work that many graduates undertake initially in order to gain valuable experience necessary advantageous for later career progression the above list is not exhaustive and there may be other important factors that are relevant to the

university senior and kennesaw resident rebecca webster s research project on the parasitic harper s dodder cuscuta harperi plant s ability to select certain plant hosts based on smell won the top poster award at the birla carbon symposium at which the college of science and mathematics csm officially recognized new birla carbon scholars the scholarship program is designed to provide ksu students with stipends for summer research in science and mathematics each student scholar works side by side with a faculty researcher on a project which deals with topics ranging from radio cesium soil contamination to the evolution of appendages many of our students are not able to explore summer research programs because they must work full time between the spring and fall semesters said csm dean mark anderson this stipend allows them time and financial freedom to expand their research skills outside of the classroom and continue kennesaw state's tradition of academic excellence birla carbon s north american region chief technology officer dale clark and birla carbon scholars director of human resources terence norman along with several judges from birla carbon reviewed posters summarizing the students research on display in the carmichael student center s university rooms on the kennesaw campus without students willing to do this kind of work this partnership between birla carbon and kennesaw state university would not be possible said clark like us you share a passion to learn to do research and to innovate the event marked the fourth year of a five year partnership with birla carbon which has allowed the college s birla carbon scholars to participate in summer research opportunities clark said four ksu graduates are currently working at the firm s marietta lab and technology center with a fifth graduate starting to work soon the scholars program was developed in april with a pledge from birla carbon for a five year annual gift of to support research opportunities for students in ksu s csm the program has awarded ksu students each a stipend since these are all very impressive projects that the students were given the opportunity to work on full time thanks to the generous support of birla carbon anderson said webster took the top prize for her research into how the parasitic harper s dodder plant selects its host based on its smell these dodder plants are a huge agricultural pest and they really like tomato plants onions and alfalfa she said not a lot is known about this foraging behavior in the dodders so i wanted to try to find out which genes are involved webster who is originally from colombia plans to graduate this spring and may work for a year in international conservation before pursuing graduate studies the most amazing thing about this plant is its ability to smell other plants she said i m trying to identify the particular genes that are responsible for this behavior this summer she worked beside her faculty mentor assistant professor of biology joel mcneal in the department of ecology evolution and organismal biology rebecca s great very bright and very industrious mcneal said even before she began her research she wanted to read every related paper on the subject along with the stipend each scholar received webster received an additional in travel funds to present her research at a national or regional conference of her choice anderson provided the group with an update on the past three birla carbon top poster award winners our first symposium winner was sam keenan who is now in medical school in tennessee the winner of the symposium eric gabilondo graduated from ksu in fall with plans to pursue a ph d in physical chemistry or chemical physics said anderson and the winner of the symposium katerina slavicinska presented research at the nd american chemical society national meeting and exposition in san francisco katerina plans to pursue graduate studies in either astrochemistry or astrobiology this year s scholars and their faculty mentors were kaylee bronson mentored by martin hudson neil dodd mentored by heather abbott lyon ian duncan mentored by heather sutton reagan hooper

matt der and mike upchurch local tech firm pursues niche business in machine learning by john reid blackwell richmond times dispatch notch s executive team includes co founders paul hurlocker from left and david der matt der and mike upchurch by john reid blackwell richmond times dispatch concepts like machine learning and artificial intelligence might conjure up images from science fiction tales about self aware robots the team of tech gurus at notch a small richmond company that specializes in machine learning have heard all that one manager s daughter has even joked with her friends about dad working for a robot company what notch really helps its clients do is less fantastic but still has great potential to revolutionize how businesses use the vast amounts of data generated in the digital economy we are a very niche company focused on some emerging areas said paul hurlocker notch s ceo who co founded the company in with david der when we started the company we saw an opportunity machine learning which fits into the broader category of artificial intelligence is now figuring into technologies such as autonomous vehicles and voice and face recognition it s one of the tools behind how companies such as amazon and netflix give customers automated product recommendations as a consulting company notch is trying to bring the benefits of machine learning to more businesses and organizations leading edge tech companies like the facebooks and googles and netflixes of the world operate on their data in a very different way than most companies do hurlocker said they are also able to leverage machine learning to do things that other companies can t do we think that is the future and the companies we work with want to move into that future he said from its office in richmond s shockoe bottom the employee company works for clients ranging from small startups to fortune companies in industries including pharmaceuticals health care retail sales finance and publishing notch does not disclose its financial results but its managers say revenue tripled last year notch is a small but fierce data company said demeria adding that it has some of the most knowledgeable data scientists and software engineers in the business their presence in richmond elevates our overall profile as a destination for machine learning and data strategy as a number of their clients are not local he said the notch team includes veterans of the richmond area technology community along with a staff of young tech specialists many of them just a few years out of virginia universities hurlocker and der met while working at amentra an information technology consulting firm founded in richmond that was acquired by red hat inc in der is now notch s chief operating officer and his two brothers bryan and matt subsequently joined the company the der brothers grew up in chester with a father who works in computer science we had it around the house growing up and while in school we all found we had a natural aptitude for mathematics david der said bryan der works as a data scientist for the company matt der earned a doctorate in computer science specializing in machine learning from the university of california at san diego he is notch s chief technology officer and thanks to his doctorate he is the one who gives the company its street cred in machine learning hurlocker said a recent addition to the management team is mike upchurch as chief strategy officer upchurch was the co founder of fuzzy logix an in database analytics company and he previously worked in investment commercial and retail banking the managers of notch believe it is the only company in the richmond region offering the services it does and one of the few in the country what makes us unique is we thrive at the intersection of machine learning and data engineering matt der said thanks to the internet and smartphones more data are being collected now than ever before and notch s data engineering service helps clients organize move and store the data they receive the data engineering helps position clients for notch s second service which is machine learning upchurch describes it as essentially using machines to crunch enormous amounts of data beyond the ability of any human and to look for patterns the machine automatically learns patterns from data matt der said i equate it with predictive analytics rather than just descriptive analytics which involves analyzing historical data to determine what happened he said a lot of companies are used to doing descriptive analytics he said that is hindsight but you can answer even more important questions if you progress from descriptive to predictive instead of asking what happened you ask what will happen if you can predict the future you can make better decisions today predictive analytics could be used to improve outcomes in many areas from preventing fraud in financial services to earlier predictions of who is most likely to get a chronic disease among patient populations machine learning tools could even be used to help identify weaknesses in the culture of an organization before it becomes a problem one of the local companies notch has been working with is tmi consulting which helps organizations improve their workplace diversity and inclusiveness notch has been assisting tmi in developing a machine learning system that can aid in the assessment and analysis of such things as employee engagement and identifying the likelihood of such problems as racial and gender bias tiffany jana tmi consulting s president and ceo said the firm has been working with various experts for about three years on the system which she hopes to offer to clients starting next year notch has been developing the machine learning tools for about a year i am used to people being a little bit confused and incredulous about the whole idea jana said but notch has done work to make it possible they have made what we brought to them times better she said this machine learning is their world they are not afraid of thinking outside the box at all in reality we are still in the early days of corporate adoption he said which means there is lots of room for a company like notch to grow the company has bootstrapped itself so far not taking any outside investors or debt hurlocker said the majority of the company s clients are not in richmond we are doing a lot of west coast work hurlocker said we have clients in chicago los angeles san diego and houston northern virginia is a growth area for us and norfolk we do have some clients in richmond but they tend to be startups hurlocker said we are passionate about working with them we are committed to trying to help the richmond startup community a lot of the software tools the company uses were developed by west coast tech companies or nonprofit software developers they have open sourced these things and we have developed expertise in those areas hurlocker said notch has remained based in richmond because its managers have close family and professional connections in the region but also because the region s technology economy has been blooming it is also a great city to start a business hurlocker said there is talent and it is affordable there are some good anchor companies in town we think richmond is on a roll in

in performance as the amount of data that they analyse grows this approach is a natural fit for climate science a single run of a high resolution climate model can produce a petabyte of data and the archive of climate data maintained by the uk met office the national weather service now holds about petabytes of information and adds petabytes a day researchers hoping to wrangle all these data will meet next month in boulder colorado to assess the state of science in the field known as climate informatics work in this area has grown rapidly in the past several years researchers have used ai systems to help them to rank climate models spot cyclones and other extreme weather events in both real and modelled climate data and identify new climate patterns the pace seems to be picking up says

roughly climate models used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change by learning the models strengths and weaknesses such algorithms generate better results than conventional approaches that treat all models equally monteleoni says the climate community is starting to adopt ai algorithms that weight climate models as a way to help improve forecasts and monteleoni has developed machine

improve forecasts machine mysteries machine mysteries because deep learning systems develop their own rules researchers often can t say how or why these algorithms arrive at a given result that makes some people uneasy about relying on these black boxes to forecast imminent weather emergencies such as floods i m reluctant to use ai as an answer machine says william drew collins a climate modeller at the lbnl if i can t explain what the machine is doing then there s a problem instead collins says that ai algorithms are best suited to help test the next generation of climate models these models aim to incorporate complex climate phenomena such as the fine structures of clouds atmospheric rivers and ocean eddies we need a benchmark of the level of detail that these models should be aiming for collins says we need a guide star machine learning is well suited for that most climatologists are still using conventional methods to analyse their data but that is changing if you go to the major modelling centres and ask them how they work the answer won t be machine learning says collins but it will get there most climatologists are still using conventional methods to analyse their data but

to operate their fleet of vehicles instead the taxicabs are operated by self driving agents known as smartcabs to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate in major metropolitan areas such as chicago new york city and san francisco an increasing number of people have come to rely on smartcabs to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible although smartcabs have become the transport of choice concerns have arose that a self driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human drivers particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles to alleviate these concerns your task as an employee for a national taxicab company is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved reinforcement learning build a dog breed classifier using a convolutional neural network

hype cycle wikipedia hype cycle contents five phases hype in new media criticisms see also references further reading external links five phases each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle technology trigger a potential technology breakthrough kicks things off early proof of concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven peak of inflated expectations early publicity produces a number of success stories often accompanied by scores of failures some companies take action most don't trough of disillusionment interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver producers of the technology shake out or fail investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters slope of enlightenment more instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood second and third generation products appear from technology providers more enterprises fund pilots conservative companies remain cautious plateau of productivity mainstream adoption starts to take off criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined the technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off hype in new media citation needed citation needed citation needed citation needed criticisms the cycle is not scientific in nature and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle the terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for the user does not want to be disappointed so should he or she stay away from technology in the trough of disillusionment no action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase this appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior see also product lifecycle kondratiev wave references april april february april march march march further reading

the top ai and machine learning use cases everyone should know about log in the top ai and machine learning use cases everyone should know about contributor machine learning is a buzzword in the technology world right now and for good reason it represents a major step forward in how computers can learn very basically a machine learning algorithm is given a teaching set of data then asked to use that data to answer a question for example you might provide a computer a teaching set of photographs some of which say this is a cat and some of which say this is not a cat then you could show the computer a series of new photos and it would begin to identify which photos were of cats machine learning then continues to add to its teaching set every photo that it identifies correctly or incorrectly gets added to the teaching set and the program effectively gets smarter and better at completing its task over time it is in effect learning if you ve flown on an airplane or attended a big public event lately you almost certainly had to wait in long security screening lines but machine learning is proving that it can be an asset to help eliminate false alarms and spot things human screeners might miss in security screenings at airports stadiums concerts and other venues that can speed up the process significantly and ensure safer events many people are eager to be able to predict what the stock markets will do on any given day for obvious reasons but machine learning algorithms are getting closer all the time many prestigious trading firms use proprietary systems to predict and execute trades at high speeds and high volume many of these rely on probabilities but even a trade with a relatively low probability at a high enough volume or speed can turn huge profits for the firms and humans can t possibly compete with machines when it comes to consuming vast quantities of data or the speed with which they can execute a trade source shutterstock you re probably familiar with this use if you use services like amazon or netflix intelligent machine learning algorithms analyze your activity and compare it to the millions of other users to determine what you might like to buy or binge watch next these recommendations are getting smarter all the time recognizing for example that you might purchase certain things as gifts and not want the item yourself or that there might be different family members who have different tv preferences perhaps the most famous use of machine learning google and its competitors are constantly improving what the search engine understands every time you execute a search on google the program watches how you respond to the results if you click the top result and stay on that web page we can assume you got the information you were looking for and the search was a success if on the other hand you click to the second page of results or type in a new search string without clicking any of the results we can surmise that the search engine didn t serve up the results you wanted and the program can learn from that mistake to deliver a better result in the future nlp is being used in all sorts of exciting applications across disciplines machine learning algorithms with natural language can stand in for customer service agents and more quickly route customers to the information they need it s being used to translate obscure legalese in contracts into plain language and help attorneys sort through large volumes of information to prepare for a case,machinelearning

machine learning are very much related but they're not quite the same thing by lee bell dec by lee bell thanks to the likes of google amazon and facebook the terms artificial intelligence ai and machine learning have become much more widespread than ever before they are often used interchangeably and promise all sorts from smarter home appliances to robots taking our jobs the uk has a new ai centre so when robots kill we know who to blame artificial intelligence but while ai and machine learning are very much related they are not quite the same thing google's new ai learns by baking tasty machine learning cookies by rowland manthorpe ai is a branch of computer science attempting to build machines capable of intelligent behaviour while stanford university defines machine learning as the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed you need ai researchers to build the smart machines but you need machine learning experts to make them truly intelligent google's new algorithm edits your photos in the blink of an eye by elizabeth stinson let s take a very simplified example when you make a typo for instance while searching in google it gives you the message did you mean this is the result of one of google's machine learning algorithms a system that detects what searches you make a couple seconds after making a certain search for example suppose you were searching for 'wired' on google but accidentally typed 'wored' after the search you'd probably realise you typed it wrong and you'd go back and search for 'wired' a couple of seconds later google s algorithm recognises that you searched for something a couple of seconds after searching something else and it keeps this in mind for future users who make a similar typing mistake as a result google 'learns' to correct it for you this ai turns foodporn into recipes you can use by matt burgess while this is a very basic example data scientists developers and researchers are using much more complex methods of machine learning to gain insights previously out of reach programs that learn from experience are helping them discover how the human genome works understand consumer behaviour to a degree never before possible and build systems for purchase recommendations image recognition and fraud prevention among other uses so now you have a basic idea of what machine learning is how is it different to that of ai we spoke to intel s nidhi chappell head of machine learning to clear this up ai is basically the intelligence how we make machines intelligent while machine learning is the implementation of the compute methods that support it the way i think of it is ai is the science and machine learning is the algorithms that make the machines smarter so the enabler for ai is machine learning she added drones and phones are the next frontier for ai breakthroughs by matt burgess chappell went on to explain that machine learning is the fastest growing part of ai so that s why we are seeing a lot of conversations around this lately even though it s a small percentage of the workloads in computing today it s the fastest growing area so that s why everyone is honing in on that simple examples are when you go to a new place and search online for top things to do the order you see them in is defined by machine learning and how they are ranked and rated this is all machine learning chappell said adding that it s the same story for when news is trending deepmind's ai learned to ride the london underground using human like reason and memory artificial intelligence microsoft wants to be a major ai player here's its master plan by bonnie christian ai has become so pervasive in our lives we don t come to recognise that it s powering a lot of things she added you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it your smartphone house bank and car already use ai on a daily basis explained facebook engineering leads yann lecun and joaquin qui onero candela sometimes it s obvious like when you ask siri to get you directions to the nearest gas station or facebook suggests a friend for you to tag in an image you posted online sometimes less so like when you use your amazon echo to make an unusual purchase on your credit card and don t get a fraud alert from your bank ai is going to bring major shifts in society through developments in self driving cars medical image analysis better medical diagnosis and personalised medicine and it will also be the backbone of many of the most innovative apps and services of tomorrow the pair continued that ai isn't magic it's just maths albeit really hard maths the three types of ai learning but in order for ai to progress machine learning must make big jumps in terms of performance and this is rarely possible in the traditional high performance computing world where problems are well defined and optimisation work has already been happening for many years machine learning algorithms still have room for improvement and that s why a lot of the large technology companies are making it a central focus to their strategy and working tirelessly to make it more intelligent in order to push forward and create the next innovation such as completely autonomous and per cent safe self driving cars recommended recommended biofuels versus petrol what's the difference by amelia heathman fossil fuels google's deepmind trains ai to cut its energy bills by by matt burgess google microsoft wants to 'solve' cancer in the next years using ai by amelia heathman health yahoo's anti abuse ai

attention into convincing the world that the machine intelligence revolution is arriving now they tout deep learning in particular as the breakthrough driving this transformation and powering new self driving cars virtual assistants and more software engineers and data scientists working with machine learning still use many of the same algorithms and engineering tools they did years ago large tech companies have recently started to use their own centralized platforms for machine learning engineering which more cleanly tie together the previously scattered workflows of data scientists and engineers what goes into a machine learning sandwich machine learning engineering happens in three stages data processing model building and deployment and monitoring in the middle we have the meat of the pipeline the model which is the machine learning algorithm that learns to predict given input data that model is where deep learning would live deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning algorithms that use multi layered neural networks to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs the more layers in the neural network the more complexity it can capture traditional statistical machine learning algorithms i e ones that do not use deep neural nets have a more limited capacity to capture information about training data but these more basic machine learning algorithms work well enough for many applications making the additional complexity of deep learning models often superfluous so we still see software engineers using these traditional models extensively in machine learning engineering even in the midst of this deep learning craze but the bread of the sandwich process that holds everything together is what happens before and after training the machine learning model the first stage involves cleaning and formatting vast amounts of data to be fed into the model the last stage involves careful deployment and monitoring of the model we found that most of the engineering time in ai is not actually spent on building machine learning models it s spent preparing and monitoring those models the meat of machine learning and avoiding exotic flavors despite the focus on deep learning at the big tech company ai research labs most applications of machine learning at these same companies do not rely on neural networks and instead use traditional machine learning models the most common models include linear logistic regression random forests and boosted decision trees these are the models behind among other services tech companies use friend suggestions ad targeting user interest prediction supply demand simulation and search result ranking and some of the tools engineers use to train these models are similarly well worn one of the most commonly used machine learning libraries is scikit learn which was released a decade ago although google s tensorflow is on the rise with traditional machine learning models the time engineers spend on model training and tuning is relatively short usually just a few hours ultimately if the accuracy improvements that deep learning can achieve are modest the need for scalability and development speed outweighs their value attempting to stick it all together tools from data to deployment the first stage in the machine learning pipeline data collection and processing illustrates this while big companies certainly have big data data scientists or engineers must clean the data to make it useful verify and consolidate duplicates from different sources normalize metrics design and prove features at most companies engineers do this using a combination sql or hive queries and python scripts to aggregate and format up to several million data points from one or more data sources this often takes several days of frustrating manual labor some of this is likely repetitive work because the process at many companies is decentralized data scientists or engineers often manipulate data with local scripts or jupyter notebooks however traditional unit tests the backbone of traditional software testing don t really work with machine learning models because the correct output of machine learning models isn t known beforehand after all the purpose of machine learning is for the model to learn to make predictions from data without the need for an engineer to specifically code any rules so instead of unit tests engineers take a less structured approach they manually monitor dashboards and program alerts for new models and shifts in real world data may make trained models less accurate so engineers re train production models on fresh data on a daily to monthly basis depending on the application but a lack of machine learning specific support in the existing engineering infrastructure can create a disconnect between models in development and models in production normal code is updated much less frequently many engineers still rely on rudimentary methods of deploying models to production like saving a serialized version of the trained model or model weights to a file engineers sometimes need to rebuild model prototypes and parts of the data pipeline in a different language or framework so they work on production infrastructure any incompatibility from any stage of the machine learning development process from data processing to training to deployment to production infrastructure can introduce error making it presentable the road forward despite all the emphasis big tech companies have placed on enhancing their products with machine learning at most companies there are still major challenges and inefficiencies in the process they still use traditional machine learning models instead of more advanced deep learning and still depend on a traditional infrastructure of tools poorly suited to machine learning fortunately with the current focus on ai at these companies they are investing in specialized tools to make machine learning work better with these internal tools or potentially with third party machine learning platforms that are able to integrate tightly into their existing infrastructures organizations can realize the

solutions marketing solutions security solutions retail solutions smb solutions how to get a job in ai or machine learning ed tittel business news daily contributor more credit phonlamai photos shutterstock computer scientist arthur samuel is rumored to have said that machine learning is an aspect of his field that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed that's why machine learning is also considered an element of artificial intelligence or ai which deals more generally with how computers can figure things out for themselves essentially the idea is that given a good set of starting rules and opportunities to interact with data and situations computers can program themselves or improve upon basic programs provided for them in the mid s computer scientists hoped to reshape computing and the ability of computers to understand and interact with the world there was a huge infusion of interest enthusiasm and cash at that time but ai did not change the world as we knew it then over time ai was found to be suitable for a relatively narrow set of computing tasks such as creating viable configurations for complex computes but ai neither set the world on fire nor redefined its boundaries and shape more than years later ai in general and machine learning are enjoying a spectacular renaissance these technologies are being successfully applied to deal with all kinds of interesting problems in computing and are enjoying a broad range of success notable accomplishments for machine learning include email filtering intrusion detection optical character recognition and computer vision machine learning and ai have proven quite effective in applying computation statistics to use data analytics to make predictions and spot trends machine learning is hot hot hot because some companies build or use technologies that employ machine learning and ai there has been considerable demand for skilled and knowledgeable researchers and developers but if anything explains a sudden sharp spike in demand for such people it's the increasingly pervasive use of predictive analytics across many fields of business most of the fortune and a great many other companies and organizations outside that fold are now using predictive analytics to seek a competitive edge or to improve their overall ability to deliver goods and services to customers clients or citizens individuals trained in machine learning are now in considerable demand across the entire employment spectrum that explains the six figure salaries that are increasingly the norm for those who land such jobs of course for many who already work in it or who are heading in that direction this raises the question of how can i get a job in ai or machine learning the answers are straightforward if somewhat labor intensive and time consuming the traditional approach get a degree make the most of mooc offerings for those who can't break away from life and work to pursue a full time degree on campus massively open online courses aka moocs offer a variety of alternatives moocs can encompass actual degree programs at reputable universities certificate programs that provide ample training but don't confer a full fledged degree or mapped out curricula in machine learning or ai that cover the ground in as much depth as one might wish to learn the subject matter udacity offers hundreds of courses of varying length complexity and depth in this area edx's machine learning offerings include a certificate program from microsoft as well as numerous graduate level courses and curricula from well known colleges and universities mit offers a plethora of online courses in this area for paid for college credit or free online audit stanford also offers a collection of machine learning courses for credit or audit hands on is where learning gets real anyone who digs into this subject matter should anticipate spending upward of hours a week on programming tasks in addition to attending lectures completing reading assignments writing papers and all the other tasks that modern learning demands of students nowadays when you're ready to rock let the world know once you've finished that degree obtained your certificate or knocked off a significant chunk of curricula you can start positioning yourself to current or prospective employers as someone with skills and knowledge in machine learning and ai unless you also have picked up some hands on real world experience in reaching this professional milestone remain humble about your skills and abilities in this arena warnings aside the prospects for those who can see themselves through the time effort and expense of mastering machine learning and ai should be bright ed is a year plus

share on pinterest share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close alex hern edt est t t the most powerful form of machine learning being used today called deep learning builds a complex mathematical structure called a neural network based on vast quantities of data designed to be analogous to how a human brain works neural networks themselves were first described in the s but it s only in the last three or four years that computers have become powerful enough to use them effectively corrado says he thinks it is as big a change for tech as the internet was before internet technologies if you worked in computer science networking was some weird thing that weirdos did and now everyone regardless of whether they re an engineer or a software developer or a product designer or a ceo understands how internet connectivity shapes their product shapes the market what they could possibly build he says that same kind of transformation is going to happen with machine learning it ends up being something that everybody can do a little of they don t have to do the detailed things but they need to understand well wait a minute maybe we could do this if we had data to learn from one of the nice things about the machine learning community right now is how open it is to sharing ideas and research when google made tensorflow open to anyone to use it wrote by sharing what we believe to be one of the best machine learning toolboxes in the world we hope to create an open standard for exchanging research ideas and putting machine learning in products and it s not alone in that every major machine learning implementation is available for free to use and modify meaning it s possible to set up a simple machine intelligence with nothing more than a laptop and a web connection which is what i did robin sloan robinsloan so i spent another few hours configuring a server on amazon s cloud to do the learning for me it cost an hour but meant that the whole thing was done in about hours i m not the only one to play around with the technology quietly starting a few years ago google itself has undergone a metamorphosis the search giant has torn out the guts of some of its biggest services from image search to voice recognition and recreated them from the ground up now it wants the rest of the world to follow suit on june it announced that it was opening a dedicated machine learning group in its zurich engineering office the largest collection of google developers outside of the us to lead research into three areas machine intelligence natural language processing and machine perception that is building systems that can think listen and see following sloan s example i set my model up to run as an autocomplete engine i could write the first half sentance of a theoretical guardian editorial and the system gets fed it as an input and asked what it thinks will come next don t like that ask it for another response i tried to use it to read guardian editorials from a parallel universe i used thursday s momentous vote to stay in the eu was as the seed and tried to get the system to imagine what the rest of the sentence would look like thursday s momentous vote to stay in the eu was more contracts in the s thursday s momentous vote to stay in the eu was a man of a legal opposition in thursday s momentous vote to stay in the eu was the discrimination and the first way the failure to declare the government is not a single constitutional conservative policy thursday s momentous vote to stay in the eu was on the promise of the pronouncements it s terrible of course it s terrible if i could train a machine to write a convincing guardian editorial or even a convincing sentence extract from a guardian editorial in two days by copying a readme and fiddling around with complex software which i don t really understand even after having successfully used it then my job would be much less secure than it is hell everyone s jobs would be much less secure than they are while the results are unimpressive on the face of it at the same time however they re kind of amazing the specific package i used called torch rnn is designed for training character level neural networks that is before it s trained it doesn t even know the concept of a word let alone have a specific vocabulary or understanding of english grammar now i have a model that knows all those things and it taught itself with nothing more than a huge quantity of guardian editorials it still can t actually create meaning that makes sense a guardian editorial has meaning in relation to the real world not as a collection of words existing in its own right and so to properly train a neural network to write one you d also have to feed in information about the world and then you ve got less of a weekend project and more of a startup pitch so it s not surprising to see the number of startup pitches that do involve deep learning skyrocket my inbox has consistently seen one or two a day for the past year from an online personal styling service which uses deep learning to match people to clothes to a knowledge discovery engine which aims to beat google at its own game where the archetypal startup of was x but on a phone and the startup of was uber but for x this year is the year of doing x with machine learning and google seems happy to be leading the way not only with its own products but also by making the tools which the rest of the ecosystem is relying on but why now corrado has an answer the maths for deep learning was done in the s and s but until now computers were too slow for us to understand that the math worked well the fact that they re getting faster and cheaper is part of what s making this possible right now he says doing machine learning yourself is like trying to go online by manually coding a tcp ip stack but that s going to change it will get quicker easier and more effective and slowly move from something

computer vision wikipedia computer vision contents definition history related fields applications typical tasks recognition motion analysis scene reconstruction image restoration system methods image understanding systems hardware see also lists references further reading external links definition history related fields the following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted applications play media play media other application areas include typical tasks each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks more or less well defined measurement problems or processing problems which can be solved using a variety of methods some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below recognition the classical problem in computer vision image processing and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object feature or activity different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature several specialized tasks based on recognition exist such as facial recognition motion analysis several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the d scene or even of the camera that produces the images examples of such tasks are scene reconstruction image restoration the aim of image restoration is the removal of noise sensor noise motion blur etc from images the simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low pass filters or median filters more sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like a model which distinguishes them from the noise by first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures such as lines or edges and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches system methods the organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent some systems are stand alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem while others constitute a sub system of a larger design which for example also contains sub systems for control of mechanical actuators planning information databases man machine interfaces etc the specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation many functions are unique to the application there are however typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems re sampling in order to assure that the image coordinate system is correct noise reduction in order to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected selection of a specific set of interest points segmentation of one or multiple image regions which contain a specific object of interest verification that the data satisfy model based and application specific assumptions estimation of application specific parameters such as object pose or object size pass fail on automatic inspection applications match no match in recognition applications flag for further human review in medical military security and recognition applications image understanding systems image understanding systems ius include three levels of abstraction as follows low level includes image primitives such as edges texture elements or regions intermediate level includes boundaries surfaces and volumes and high level includes objects scenes or events many of these requirements are really topics for further research the representational requirements in the designing of ius for these levels are representation of prototypical concepts concept organization spatial knowledge temporal knowledge scaling and description by comparison and differentiation hardware there are many kinds of computer vision systems nevertheless all of them contain these basic elements a power source at least one image acquisition device i e camera ccd etc a processor as well as control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism in addition a practical vision system contains software as well as a display in order to monitor the system vision systems for inner spaces as most industrial ones contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment furthermore a completed system includes many accessories like camera supports cables and connectors most computer vision systems use visible light cameras passively viewing a

quantum machine learning home physics quantum physics quantum machine learning language acquisition in young children is apparently connected with their ability to detect patterns in their learning process they search for patterns in the data set that help them identify and optimize grammar structures in order to properly acquire the language likewise online translators use algorithms through machine learning techniques to optimize their translation engines to produce well rounded and understandable outcomes even though many translations did not make much sense at all at the beginning in these past years we have been able to see major improvements thanks to machine learning machine learning techniques use mathematical algorithms and tools to search for patterns in data these techniques have become powerful tools for many different applications which can range from biomedical uses such as in cancer reconnaissance in genetics and genomics in autism monitoring and diagnosis and even plastic surgery to pure applied physics for studying the nature of materials matter or even complex quantum systems capable of adapting and changing when exposed to a new set of data machine learning can identify patterns often outperforming humans in accuracy although machine learning is a powerful tool certain application domains remain out of reach due to complexity or other aspects that rule out the use of the predictions that learning algorithms provide thus in recent years quantum machine learning has become a matter of interest because of is vast potential as a possible solution to these unresolvable challenges and quantum computers show to be the right tool for its solution firstly they set out to give an in depth view of the status of current supervised and unsupervised learning protocols in classical machine learning by stating all applied methods they introduce quantum machine learning and provide an extensive approach on how this technique could be used to analyse both classical and quantum data emphasizing that quantum machines could accelerate processing timescales thanks to the use of quantum annealers and universal quantum computers quantum annealing technology has better scalability but more limited use cases for instance the latest iteration of d wave's superconducting chip integrates two thousand qubits and it is used for solving certain hard optimization problems and for efficient sampling on the other hand universal also called gate based quantum computers are harder to scale up but they are able to perform arbitrary unitary operations on qubits by sequences of quantum logic gates this resembles how digital computers can perform arbitrary logical operations on classical bits however they address the fact that controlling a quantum system is very complex and analyzing classical data with quantum resources is not as straightforward as one may think mainly due to the challenge of building quantum interface devices that allow classical information to be encoded into a quantum mechanical form difficulties such as the input or output problems appear to be the major technical challenge that needs to be overcome the ultimate goal is to find the most optimized method that is able to read comprehend and obtain the best outcomes of a data set be it classical or quantum quantum machine learning is definitely aimed at revolutionizing the field of computer sciences not only because it will be able to control quantum computers speed up the information processing rates far beyond current classical velocities but also because it is capable of carrying out innovative functions such quantum deep learning that could not only recognize counter intuitive patterns in data invisible to both classical machine learning and to the human eye but also reproduce them as peter wittek finally states writing this paper was quite a challenge we had a committee of six co authors with different ideas about what the field is where it is now and where it is going we rewrote the paper from scratch three times the final version could not have been completed without the dedication of our editor to whom we are indebted featured last

a machine learning introductory tutorial with examples toptal start hiring login top why clients partners community blog about us start hiring apply as a developer login questions contact us start hiring login an introduction to machine learning theory and its applications a visual tutorial with examples shares marisela ordaz machine learning ml is coming into its own with a growing recognition that ml can play a key role in a wide range of critical applications such as data mining natural language processing image recognition and expert systems ml provides potential solutions in all these domains and more and is set to be a pillar of our future civilization what is machine learning so if you want your program to predict for example traffic patterns at a busy intersection task t you can run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past traffic patterns experience e and if it has successfully learned it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns performance measure p among the different types of ml tasks a crucial distinction is drawn between supervised and unsupervised learning we will primarily focus on supervised learning here but the end of the article includes a brief discussion of unsupervised learning with some links for those who are interested in pursuing the topic further supervised machine learning so let s say our simple predictor has this form a simple machine learning example we stick to simple problems in this post for the sake of illustration but the reason ml exists is because in the real world the problems are much more complex on this flat screen we can draw you a picture of at most a three dimensional data set but ml problems commonly deal with data with millions of dimensions and very complex predictor functions ml solves problems that cannot be solved by numerical means alone with that in mind let s look at a simple example say we have the following training data wherein company employees have rated their satisfaction on a scale of to first notice that the data is a little noisy that is while we can see that there is a pattern to it i e employee satisfaction tends to go up as salary goes up it does not all fit neatly on a straight line this will always be the case with real world data and we absolutely want to train our machine using real world data so then how can we train a machine to perfectly predict an employee s level of satisfaction the answer of course is that we can t the goal of ml is never to make perfect guesses because ml deals in domains where there is no such thing the goal is to make guesses that are good enough to be useful if we ask this predictor for the satisfaction of an employee making k it would predict a rating of it s obvious that this was a terrible guess and that this machine doesn t know very much and if we repeat this process say times our predictor will end up looking like this now we re getting somewhere a note on complexity this function takes input in four dimensions and has a variety of polynomial terms deriving a normal equation for this function is a significant challenge many modern machine learning problems take thousands or even millions of dimensions of data to build predictions using hundreds of coefficients predicting how an organism s genome will be expressed or what the climate will be like in fifty years are examples of such complex problems fortunately the iterative approach taken by ml systems is much more resilient in the face of such complexity instead of using brute force a machine learning system feels its way to the answer for big problems this works much better while this doesn t mean that ml can solve all arbitrarily complex problems it can t it does make for an incredibly flexible and powerful tool gradient descent minimizing wrongness with least squares the penalty for a bad guess goes up quadratically with the difference between the guess and the correct answer so it acts as a very strict measurement of wrongness the cost function computes an average penalty over all of the training examples consider the following plot of a cost function for some particular ml problem that covers the basic theory underlying the majority of supervised machine learning systems but the basic concepts can be applied in a variety of different ways depending on the problem at hand classification problems under supervised ml two major subcategories are our examples so far have focused on regression problems so let s now also take a look at a classification example in classification a regression predictor is not very useful what we usually want is a predictor that makes a guess somewhere between and in a cookie quality classifier a prediction of would represent a very confident guess that the cookie is perfect and utterly mouthwatering a prediction of represents high confidence that the cookie is an embarrassment to the cookie industry values falling within this range represent less confidence so we might design our system such that prediction of means man that s a tough call but i m gonna go with yes you can sell that cookie while a value exactly in the middle at might represent complete uncertainty this isn t always how confidence is distributed in a classifier but it s a very common design and works for purposes of our illustration so that our predictor becomes notice that the sigmoid function transforms our output into the range between and this behavior is captured by the log function such that a classification predictor can be visualized by drawing the boundary line i e the barrier where the prediction changes from a yes a prediction greater than to a no a prediction less than with a well designed system our cookie data can generate a classification boundary that looks like this now that s a machine that knows a thing or two about cookies an introduction to neural networks neural networks are well suited to machine learning problems where the number of inputs is gigantic the computational cost of handling such a problem is just too overwhelming for the types of systems we ve discussed above as it turns out however neural networks can be effectively tuned using techniques that are strikingly similar to gradient descent in principle unsupervised machine learning unsupervised learning typically is tasked with finding relationships within data there are no training examples used in this process instead the system is given a set data and tasked with finding patterns and correlations therein a good example is identifying close knit groups of friends in social network data conclusion we ve covered much of the basic theory underlying the field of machine learning here but of course we have only barely scratched the surface keep in mind that to really apply the theories contained in this introduction to real life machine learning examples a much deeper understanding of the topics discussed herein is necessary there are many subtleties and pitfalls in ml and many ways to be lead astray by what appears to be a perfectly well tuned thinking machine almost every part of the basic theory can be played with and altered endlessly and the results are often fascinating many grow into whole new fields of study that are better suited to particular problems acknowledgement about the author shares comments

system in this article we introduce michelangelo discuss product use cases and walk through the workflow of this powerful new ml as a service system motivation behind michelangelo motivation behind michelangelo specifically there were no systems in place to build reliable uniform and reproducible pipelines for creating and managing training and prediction data at scale prior to michelangelo it was not possible to train models larger than what would fit on data scientists desktop machines and there was neither a standard place to store the results of training experiments nor an easy way to compare one experiment to another most importantly there was no established path to deploying a model into production in most cases the relevant engineering team had to create a custom serving container specific to the project at hand at the same time we were starting to see signs of many of the ml anti patterns documented by scully et al michelangelo is designed to address these gaps by standardizing the workflows and tools across teams though an end to end system that enables users across the company to easily build and operate machine learning systems at scale our goal was not only to solve these immediate problems but also create a system that would grow with the business michelangelo is designed to address these gaps by standardizing the workflows and tools across teams though an end to end system that enables users across the company to easily build and operate machine learning systems at scale our goal was not only to solve these immediate problems but also create a system that would grow with the business when we began building michelangelo in mid we started by addressing the challenges around scalable model training and deployment to production serving containers then we focused on building better systems for managing and sharing feature pipelines more recently the focus shifted to developer productivity how to speed up the path from idea to first production model and the fast iterations that follow in the next section we look at an example application to understand how michelangelo has been used to build and deploy models to solve specific problems at uber while we highlight a specific use case for ubereats the platform manages dozens of similar models across the company for a variety of prediction use cases use case ubereats estimated time of delivery model use case ubereats estimated time of delivery model ubereats has several models running on michelangelo covering meal delivery time predictions search rankings search autocomplete and restaurant rankings the delivery time models predict how much time a meal will take to prepare and deliver before the order is issued and then again at each stage of the delivery process ubereats has several models running on michelangelo covering meal delivery time predictions search rankings search autocomplete and restaurant rankings the delivery time models predict how much time a meal will take to prepare and deliver before the order is issued and then again at each stage of the delivery process figure the ubereats app hosts an estimated delivery time feature powered by machine learning models built on michelangelo predicting meal estimated time of delivery etd is not simple when an ubereats customer places an order it is sent to the restaurant for processing the restaurant then needs to acknowledge the order and prepare the meal which will take time depending on the complexity of the order and how busy the restaurant is when the meal is close to being ready an uber delivery partner is dispatched to pick up the meal then the delivery partner needs to get to the restaurant find parking walk inside to get the food then walk back to the car drive to the customer s location which depends on route traffic and other factors find parking and walk to the customer s door to complete the delivery the goal is to predict the total duration of this complex multi stage process as well as recalculate these time to delivery predictions at every step of the process predicting meal estimated time of delivery etd is not simple when an ubereats

either due to local or upstream code or data issues models that are deployed online cannot access data stored in hdfs and it is often difficult to compute some features in a performant manner directly from the online databases that back uber s production services for instance it is not possible to directly query the ubereats order service to compute the average meal prep time for a restaurant over a specific period of time instead we allow features needed for online models to be precomputed and stored in cassandra where they can be read at low latency at prediction time models that are deployed

features to only be updated every few hours or once a day this system guarantees that the same data and batch pipeline is used for both training and serving ubereats uses this system for features like

using just its uuid and then modify a configuration in the client or intermediate service to gradually switch traffic from the old model uuid to the new one for a b testing of models users can simply deploy competing models either via uuids or tags and then use uber s experimentation framework from within the client service to send portions of the traffic to each model and track performance metrics for a b testing of models users can simply deploy competing models either via uuids or tags and then use uber s experimentation framework from within the client service to send portions of the traffic to each model and track performance metrics since machine learning models are stateless and share nothing they are trivial to scale out both in online and offline serving modes in the case of online models we can simply add more hosts to the prediction service cluster and let the load balancer spread the load in the case of offline predictions we can add more spark executors and let spark manage the parallelism since machine learning models are stateless and share nothing they are trivial to scale out both in online and offline serving modes in the case of online models we can simply

online serving latency depends on model type and complexity and whether or not the model requires features from the cassandra feature store in the case of a model that does not need features from cassandra we typically see p latency of less than milliseconds ms in the case of models that do require features from cassandra we typically see p latency of less than ms the highest traffic models

and better support the needs of our business in the coming months we plan to continue scaling and hardening the existing system to support both the growth of our set of customer teams and uber s business overall as the platform layers mature we plan to invest in higher level tools and services to drive democratization of machine learning and better support the needs of our business this will be a system for automatically searching and discovering model configurations algorithm feature sets hyper parameter values etc that result in the best performing models for given modeling problems the system would also automatically build the production data pipelines to generate the features and labels needed to power the models we have addressed big pieces of this already with our feature store our unified offline and online data pipelines and hyper parameter search feature we plan to accelerate our earlier data science work through automl the system would allow data scientists to specify a set of labels and an objective function and then would make the most privacy and security aware use of uber s data to find the best model for the problem the goal is to amplify data scientist productivity with smart tools that make their job easier understanding and debugging models is increasingly important especially for deep learning while we have made some important first steps with visualization tools for tree based models much more needs to be done to enable data scientists to understand debug and tune their models and for users to trust the results most of uber s machine learning models directly affect the uber product in real time this means they operate in the complex and ever changing environment of moving things in the physical world to keep our models accurate as this environment changes our models need to change with it today teams are regularly retraining their models in michelangelo a full platform solution to this use case involves easily updateable model types faster training and evaluation architecture and pipelines automated model validation and deployment and sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems though a big project early results suggest substantial potential gains from doing online learning right an increasing number of uber s machine learning systems are implementing deep learning technologies the user workflow of defining and iterating on deep learning models is sufficiently different from the standard workflow such that it needs unique platform support deep learning use cases typically handle a larger quantity of data and different hardware requirements i e gpus motivate further investments into distributed learning and a tighter integration with a flexible resource management stack if you are interesting in tackling

what is machine learning a complete beginner's guide in log in what is machine learning a complete beginner's guide in contributor computers have helped us to calculate the vastness of space and the minute details of subatomic particles when it comes to counting and calculating or following logical yes no algorithms computers outperform humans thanks to the electrons moving through their circuitry at the speed of light but we generally don t consider them as intelligent because traditionally computers haven t been able to do anything themselves without being taught programmed by us first so far even if a computer had access to all of the information in the world it couldn t do anything smart with it it could find us a picture of a cat but only because we had told it that certain pictures contain cats in other words ask it to find a picture of a cat and it will return with a picture which it has been told is of a cat this has several implications which limit its helpfulness not least that a large amount of human time has to be spent telling it what every picture contains the data pictures need to pass through a human bottleneck where they are labelled before the computer can with lightning quick precision identify it as a cat picture and show it to us when we request it while this works well enough if we are just searching for cat pictures on google to pass our time if we want to do something more advanced such as monitor a live video feed and tell us when a cat wanders in front of the camera it s not so great how did machine learning come about shutterstock as knowledge something to draw insight from and a basis for making decisions is deeply integral to learning these early computers were severely handicapped due to the lack of data at their disposal without all of the digital technology we have today to capture and store information from the analogue world machines could only learn from data slowly inputted through punch cards and later magnetic tapes and storage,machinelearning

what is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning log in what is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning contributor they are not quite the same thing but the perception that they are can sometimes lead to some confusion so i thought it would be worth writing a piece to explain the difference in short the best answer is that artificial intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider smart and machine learning is a current application of ai based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves early days as technology and importantly our understanding of how our minds work has progressed our concept of what constitutes ai has changed rather than increasingly complex calculations work in the field of ai concentrated on mimicking human decision making processes and carrying out tasks in ever more human ways artificial intelligences devices designed to act intelligently are often classified into one of two fundamental groups applied or general applied ai is far more common systems designed to intelligently trade stocks and shares or manoeuvre an autonomous vehicle would fall into this category neural networks artificial intelligence and machine learning source shutterstock generalized ais systems or devices which can in theory handle any task are less common but this is where some of the most exciting advancements are happening today it is also the area that has led to the development of machine learning often referred to as a subset of ai it s really more accurate to think of it as the current state of the art the rise of machine learning two important breakthroughs led to the emergence of machine learning as the vehicle which is driving ai development forward with the speed it currently has,machinelearning

are the differences between data mining machine learning and deep learning data mining can be considered a superset of many different methods to extract insights from data it might involve traditional statistical methods and machine learning data mining applies methods from many different areas to identify previously unknown patterns from data this can include statistical algorithms machine learning text analytics time series analysis and other areas of analytics data mining also includes the study and practice of data storage and data manipulation the main difference with machine learning is that just like statistical models the goal is to understand the structure of the data fit theoretical distributions to the data that are well understood so with statistical models there is a theory behind the model that is mathematically proven but this requires that data meets certain strong assumptions too machine learning has developed based on the ability to use computers to probe the data for structure even if we do not have a theory of what that structure looks like the test for a machine learning model is a validation error on new data not a theoretical test that proves a null hypothesis because machine learning often uses an iterative approach to learn from data the learning can be easily automated passes are run through the data until a robust pattern is found using

machine learning continuously eliminates errors to improve predictions this sounds like science fiction and seems to give computers a mythical power they do not have machine learning for prediction is a practical device many companies are using to make sense of the metrics they collect what are predictive analytics prediction is one of the major purposes of correlational statistics although sometimes prediction is not quite the right word for it the idea is that you want to see if you can find the components of a certain important variable you have a number of measurements and you want to see what proportion of the variance of the important variable is contributed by each of the measures you have you want to know how much each variable uniquely contributes to the variance and how the whole array of your measurements can contribute when taken together the word prediction often has nothing to do with the future but simply being able to tell what the value of the important variable is without looking at it prediction is one of the major purposes of correlational statistics although sometimes prediction is not quite the right word for it the idea is that you want to see

often has nothing to do with the future but simply being able to tell what the value of the important variable is without looking at it you do this predicting using statistical techniques based on an inter correlation matrix you want to find the weights to assign to each of your measures to make the sum of all your measured variables make the best possible prediction of the important variable for example you might want to predict sales volume based on a lot of data mined information about the population that includes your customers for example you might want to predict sales volume based on a lot of data mined information about the population that includes your customers for a sampled time period when you know the sales volume you use the data you have in numeric form for a sampled time period when you know the sales volume you use the data you have in numeric form you do an inter correlation matrix including the sales volume number you do an inter correlation matrix including the sales volume number from the inter correlation matrix you derive a multivariate regression formula this is a formula when you plug your measures into it the result will be as close as possible to sales volume how far off the average prediction is from the actual value of sales volume is the amount of error in your prediction how far off the average prediction is from the actual value of sales

you make three sets of data to train and test the machine learning you make three sets of data to train and test the machine learning a training set consisting of the majority to percent of the preliminary data you collected this data is used to train the machine to learn a validation set consisting of to percent of the data collected you use this data to see just how accurate your predictions are after the machine is trained you may try out different algorithms here a test set consisting of data not used in the training or validation you use this data as a final test of the validity of your chosen machine algorithm machine learning is an iterative process you train the machine to make the best predictions using a particular algorithm then based on the accuracy of prediction you retrain it modifying your algorithm or parameters in your data set you try to reach a point that the machine predicts all sales no misses or false negatives and does not say a case will be sale when it is not false positive machine learning is an iterative process you train the machine to make the best predictions using a particular algorithm then based on the accuracy of prediction you retrain it modifying your algorithm or parameters in your data set you try to reach a point that the machine predicts all sales no misses or false negatives and does not say a case will be sale when it is not false positive once a satisfactory level of performance has been reached on the validation set use the test set to assess the performance of the fully trained system on unseen data if the test set performance is satisfactory you have a computer model that can be used to predict the behavior of real customers with acceptable accuracy once a satisfactory level of performance has been

alander mountain hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley main menu home the hikes store faq leave no trace alander mountain super cool google earth flyover of hike route google terrain map of hike route the summit of alander mountain is unique for this area in that there s no one place you can point to and say this is the best spot to take in the view the grass rocks and low bushes along the trail at the summit allow you to stop wherever you d like grab a seat and create your own personal money spot for all the beauty you ll find here you won t be bothered by crowds unless perhaps you re competing for a spot in the cabin near the summit actually that s been empty both times i ve been up here so maybe crowds aren t an issue there either on the sunny spring day when i was here last there were a few people lazing about near the summit but not nearly as many as there should have been this is a gorgeous hike that should be high on your to do list if you re willing to burn a few thousand calories to earn some awesome views from the parking area head downhill along the road for a couple hundred yards back to the trailhead on your right careful on the side of the road if i m not mistaken that is one of the biggest fields of poison ivy i ve ever seen this is the only spot i noticed any poison ivy along the hike from the trailhead which is clearly marked with several signs on a tree facing the road hop on the blue blazed alander brook trail only miles from here to the junction with alander mountain trail at the summit piece of cake strenuous strenuous cake for the first mile or so the trail is pretty flat enjoy it while you can in just a couple of minutes after taking in the nice view across the field to your left you ll come to the junction with the robert brook trail which is marked by a tree that is eating the sign turn left here to stay on the alander brook trail this is the beginning of the loop you ll come back down via the robert brook trail later when you re much more tired and sweaty in minutes you ll cross over a culvert which is what you call those big honking metal pipes according to the internet that directs alander brook under the trail directly after this culvert make a hard right to stay on the blue trail if you went straight left here which looks logical you d end up on a spur trail to nowhere so try not to do that the picture on the left was taken after i d already crossed the culvert so that s the view looking back update shortly after the culvert the trail reminds you that you are indeed climbing a mountain the next junction to look for is with the white blazed south taconic trail it took us minutes to get to that junction from the culvert including stops to take pictures of salamanders when you arrive at the south taconic trail which joins you from the left careful you don t stroll past it you ll have climbed about feet from the parking area you might want to take a breather at this junction because the south taconic trail isn t going to take it any easier on you after you ve caught your breath take a left to head uphill on the south taconic trail you ll take a few steps up the bank then curve right with the trail at the tree with the south taconic trail sign on it you have about vertical feet to climb until you ll pop out into some awesome views just keep trudging up the south taconic trail and all your hard work will be rewarded soon from the alander brook south taconic trail junction it took me about minutes to get to the views slogging slowly along wondering how my two year old could possibly weigh pounds and all of a sudden there they are those views keep making your way up the trail stopping often to look at the view behind you there s no one place along this several hundred yard length of trail that is the best place to take in the view if you see a spot that looks good for a picnic or break by all means plunk down and gaze into the distance for a while on your left after some more steep climbing you might notice a sign that tells you you ve come miles that s all from the alander brook trail only more feet to go until the next trail junction update september optional step turn left to head north on the south taconic trail and see some different views this will add about minutes of hiking to your day and it will be up and back returning you to this spot if you want to see them turn left and head through the thick underbrush for a few hundred yards stopping when you get to a small rocky and grassy clearing the views here aren t earth shattering compared to what you ve just seen but they d be a destination on any other mountain after you ve taken them in return to the junction with the sign sticking out of the rock cairn if you re running low on energy you shouldn t feel like you re missing out on too much if you skip this step i skipped it the last time i was here the mile length for this hike does not include this optional step from the junction with the rock cairn facing the sign as if you ve just arrived from step above whether you did the optional step or not turn right to head toward the mass park hq goodbye for now south taconic trail see you again soon in just a moment you ll see a cabin through the trees head down the bank to pay it a visit from what i can tell this place is first come first served and free since there s no camping allowed up here otherwise the wooden bunks in this cabin look like the only option for sleeping on alander mountain from the front door of the cabin look back uphill the way you just came down straight ahead you ll see a sign directing you to the right for the alander mt trail alander mt summit and south taconic trail you could retrace your steps to return to your car back this way if you d like but i like a good loop and the way we ll take down also has some nice views it s about the same distance either way walk up to that sign and turn left into the great unknown or at least the great unmentioned on that sign since it doesn t say what happens when you go left update june a friend of mine got lost at this spot so i d like to make sure we re absolutely crystal clear on the directions here face the front door of the cabin now turn right and head back the way you came very briefly in just a moment you should the see sign pictured just above with three arrows pointing right at this sign turn left if you were to make a left turn while facing the front door of the cabin you d end up descending mt alander on the wrong side coming several miles later to the mt washington st forest hq in massachusetts which is what my friend did her group found a nice hiker to drive them back to their car at the other trailhead a twenty minute drive which was very fortunate and cool of that hiker but let s do our best to have you avoid hitchhiking today shall we dude seriously you might be asking yourself right about now as the single track blue blazed trail makes its way through a dense mountain laurel thicket i promise the going gets much easier in just a few minutes you re now on the alander loop trail preparing to make a well deserved descent about five minutes after turning onto the alander loop trail you ll come to a small clearing with limited views if you haven t already stopped for lunch or a snack this is probably your best bet for the rest of the hike even though you can t see the views when you re sitting keep heading down the blue blazed alander loop trail just when you thought you were done with views for the day you get some more you ll keep losing altitude for a solid half hour after that small clearing with limited views then the alander loop trail dead ends into the white blazed south taconic trail turn left to go gently uphill along the south taconic trail does the south taconic trail ever go downhill the trickiest junction of the entire hike is coming up in about minutes it s a right turn onto the red blazed robert brook trail keep a sharp eye out for it if you weren t paying attention it d be easy to stroll right past it if you looking for it though you shouldn t have a problem there are plenty of blazes when you see those dark red blazes turn right onto the robert brook trail if you miss the turn enjoy the summit of brace mountain in about two miles or so no but seriously don t miss the turn thankfully you re headed downhill again about five minutes after you turn onto the robert brook trail you ll pass a concrete ny ma state line marker in another five minutes you ll pass another one for some reason we like our state borders clearly marked indeed we do directly after that second marker be sure to take a right to stay on the robert brook trail i m not sure where that trail coming in from the left goes but it s definitely not to your car keep steadily descending giving away all that altitude you worked so hard to earn it took us minutes from the start of the robert brook trail to reach the eponymous robert brook once you cross that brook you re very close to the finish line less than ten minutes after crossing the stream probably much less my son wanted out of the bag so he walked the rest of the way to the car from here throwing off my time estimates a bit you ll arrive back at the junction with the sign eating tree hooray take a left to head back down the short trail to the road at the road go left to return to your car watch for traffic and wait to collapse until you re past all the poison ivy phew you made it i hope you have something delicious for dinner

on the southern end of the blue alander loop trail where it dead ends in step saying that the trail is closed and advising to ascend alander mtn using the south taconic trail no explanation as to why sorry i didn t think to snap a photo i don t know if there s a similar sign up at the northern end of the trail kelly said i noticed that too did the hike today and it was awesome i saw that sign on the way down but there was not one at the top i used nynjtc map and it helped particularly around the cabin junction great time but this was definitely a challenging hike for me quite steep up and down but ioved it would be amazing in the fall brendan said great tr i m hoping to head out there next weekend april th i m actually hoping to come across some rattlers to photograph has anyone come across them this early in the season just for fun i ve included a photo of a copperhead i took last week in connecticut mike said hi brendan i heard from a friend who saw a rattler at minnewaska about a week ago so they are apparently out and about in the area the snake didn t even rattle as he gently nudged it off the trail with a long stick he took a video of the proceedings and the snake seemed awfully mellow about the whole thing i ve never seen a copperhead before and hope to keep that streak going thanks for the nice pic hope you had plenty of zoom on that lens and i hope any rattlers you find have pleasant dispositions cathy said hi i just got back from trying this hike and had some difficulty at step we came to a junction with the blue x on the tree looked at your directions which said to keep going straight and continued straight on a trail that was a bit overgrown we hiked for quite a long time unable to find the south taconic trail turnoff after awhile fearful we had screwed up we headed back the way we had come at the junction where the tree with the x is i tried the other trail which would have been a right turn at the junction not straight and eventually saw a blue blaze on a tree eureka by now it was getting too late to continue but i assume this is the correct way i would suggest changing the directions to indicate that you bear right at the intersection with the blue x we have enjoyed using your maps and love the photos keep it up mike said cathy i m so sorry to hear this looking back over the directions above i m pretty sure things went off the rails on step here s what the trail guide says directly after this culvert make a hard right to stay on the blue trail if you went straight left here which looks logical you d end up on a spur trail to nowhere so try not to do that if you thought you were on step at that point you would have been looking at these instructions you might notice another trail joining from the left with a big blue x on the tree to tell you not to go that way take that x s advice and keep heading straight uphill on the blue trail it sounds to me like you probably ended up on the spur trail to nowhere mentioned in step does that sound like the right prognosis is there anything i could change in the text that would have helped to avoid this problem hope you have a better run at it next time and i hope we can help others to avoid the same fate cathy said hi mike actually i did make the hard right to stay on the blue trail after the culvert there was a sort of big climb after that and then i arrived at the intersection with the x on the tree mentioned at that point we would have to turn right again to stay on the blue trail left would turn us toward the tree with the x this is where we goofed your directions said keep straight uphill so we went straight i think the directions would be correct if you said at the junction bear right uphill on the blue trail i plan to try the hike again so will take some photos to clear up what i mean thanks for your response mike said this is very helpful cathy thank you i just updated step above with a warning to make sure nobody else hits this same problem let me know if that doesn t do the trick na said how come the red dots on the map don t say which junction it is it s completely unclear which way you ascended and descended the map i m looking at from the mt washington sf government site does not even show an alander loop trail this is utter mike said pleasure to meet you na when i first created this site the everytrail com maps that i d create from my gps data would include waypoint labels and animations of the hike route for some reason everytrail made changes that removed the animations and stripped out the waypoint labels hence the red pins with no text i agree that it s less than ideal for this hike i just scrapped the everytrail link and created a new google map that includes the waypoint labels try clicking the link in the gps goodies section above and see if you don t find it more useful now you can also read the perhaps too copious text above to figure out which way i tackled this hike hope this all helps you to have a nice adventure out there thanks for stopping by unavailable said thank you lol i became frustrated trying to puzzle together the way went through reading your account and going back and forth with the red dots perhaps my reading comprehension is not what it once was but i was almost sure that you took the other way up and the left turn near the ny mass border was where you picked up the stc in step but then i realized the steps didn t in anyway correspond to the red dots and i had no idea of which way you went up in any event great site and interesting accounts by the way i know you know this but you were in the heart of timber rattler territory with dens close by when you sat on that rock on the loop trail for a break but i m sure you kept a close eye on the kid what an experience he s lucky to have had at such a young age i have one last question in your opinion which of these mountains has the best views i have time to hike maybe two this fall i don t live close by i know this is relative but as far as views would you choose alander brace race bear frissell or everett i m leaning toward alander and race and bear my third option if i have the time are braces best views toward the catskills rather than the rest of the taconics maybe bear should replace race what say you my toddler toting unafraid of sitting next to rattlesnakes for a break south taconic mountain expert mike said thanks for the nice follow up unavailable i just added a timber rattler warning to my two alander trail guides just to make sure everyone knows to step carefully out there as for ranking the views in the taconics i would recommend brace via the south taconic trail listed as brace mountain ii on this site then alander via either route then race which i did last year and will write up one of these days beautiful hike but the view isn t as good as brace or alander i haven t done bear or everett and frissell doesn t have much of a view hope that helps not applicable said thank you that definitely helps with my decision i have a hard time with those sandy said did this hike about a week ago as you put it so succinctly great views steep climb i just want to point out that the sign mentioned in steps the sign sticking out of the rock cairn is in bad shape when we got there it was in pieces only piece that was barely hanging on was still attached it was hanging at an angle with arrows in the wrong direction it was impossible to use that sign as it was for directions you wisely tell folks to go right to continue the loop when they get to that junction i would just reiterate it here don t worry about what the sign says or which way it appears to be pointing just go right at that junction btw met some nynj trail conference folks on the way down told them about the sign they said they were aware but with so many signs to maintain don t know when they ll get to it the pic i posted of the sign is after i picked up a fallen piece kind of leaned it next to the attached piece mike said thank you sandy i ve just updated the trail guide at step with a link down to your comment very much appreciated keerthana said this is so awesome i wish i had seen this before doing this hike yesterday i took the alander trail went past the south taconic into the white traill then switched to blue trail we reached at the cabin and continued upwards to the summit the summit was a big tease as there was a breathtaking view after every big ascent we took however it was not the top so we kept going up and up forever but got to say the almost degree view at the summit was worth every bit on our way back we had a visitor a black timber rattle snake around feet right on the middle of the trail path it was quite an experience i definitely plan on going back to try a different trail to the mount your record of the trails are amazing it will definitely help me when i go back thank you amanda said just want to say thank you i followed this post to a t today i didn t miss a single turn loved the pictures and landmarks you doing this with a kid made it feel super attainable took me hours to do the loop stopped at the cabin to have lunch great day man thanks for helping me have the confidence in the trails met rattlesnakes today on the trails super cool danit said just a quick thank you your instructions were very helpful nyebone said i did this hike yesterday altho in the opposite direction i got quite confused near the cabin by the sign pointing to the summit this is contradictory to the summit location on my nynj trail map hence the confusion i needed my compass to figure out which direction to continue south perhaps i m getting a little senile at age w years hiking experience anyhoo a wonderful hike thanks for posting it on your great website john said john said john you seriously need to listen to my advice about posting after while you re imbibing ricky said thanks for the great guide i plan on trying this weekend is it possible to take the blue trail all the way up i m a bit confused by the directions why do you not turn towards the arrow pointing to the summit mike said hope you have a great trip ricky you could finagle a trip to the top using only the blue trail but that would be a different hike than the one outlined above and i ve never tried it before if you re referring to step above you turn away from the summit because at that point you ve already visited the summit so you turn left there to continue along the loop i hope this is helpful let me know if i didn t answer your question jay said pardon meh but is there directions to the trailhead parking on this page jay said delete delete found them sorry on the other page alander ii the directions were at the top jay said oh no they weren t they were at the bottom haha good stuff i should start smoking weed again it makes me more perceptive jay said thanks for the detailed directions on your hike reviews extremely helpful mbow said it poured out so i guess he was sun bathing he wasn t aggressive or anything but god was he big and he was also blocking our path we ended up having to cut through the brush to get around him mike said thanks for the heads up seems like this area including brace mountain is not in any danger of running out of rattlesnakes anytime soon in my experience bumping into a rattlesnake is one of those things that s very cool in retrospect glad you didn t get any better acquainted with him than you did for the sign issue please let me know if an update to the guide above could be helpful to help others avoid the same fate thanks for taking time to drop a comment mbow mbow said it shouldn t be a major problem for anyone as long they know how to tell north south east west we were just so confused when we looked at the sign and south was north and north was south we should have just listened to instinct really but we followed the sign and later realized it was totally turned around but yea the rattlesnake was beautiful for sure definitely a bit alarming but a fun time i want to go back and try and get brace mountain done by the end of the fall jacquelyn pierce said thanks so much for the detailed guide without you i would of been very lost jim hall said mike hi first off thanks for all of the work that you have done on all of the trails i have hiked more than five this summer and fall all of your trail advise has been very helpful i am thinking of hiking alander mt this weekend and would like your opinion on the possible conditions do you know if anyone has tried this late in the year any advise would be appreciated thanks jim mike said hi jim glad to hear the site has been useful for you i ve never tried it this late in the year and especially after the snowfall we got last night along with fallen leaves i d expect the trail conditions to be pretty dicey and more difficult to follow if you have experience with this kind of thing it d be beautiful up there but my blanket recommendation would be that it might be better to wait until spring or at least until we have a good long dry warm ish stretch good luck if you give it a go jim hall said mike thanks for information i think i might try brace mt i am hopeful that you did not get that much snow up north i live in westchester and that today s temps melt what ever you did get i don t plan on pushing it if the conditions look that bad i just need to get out and have done all of the difficult hikes nearer to me i will let you if i make it and what the conditions were like thanks again for your hard work on this website i love it and have recommended to many friends jim clayton h said mike said thanks clayton i ran into a rattler on nearby brace mountain and i don t recall finding the humor in the whole thing until way way later they re apparently all over the place in the taconics step carefully out there everyone jay said i couldn t believe how much it will cost for the large doses of anti venom for the timber rattler bite considering that you need times the dosage amount for other rattlers does anyone have any personal recommendations for a good snake bite kit i like to hear from people who have actually had to use them kind of hard to find those types of reviews which i guess is good in a sense chris said mike said not sure why i didn t reply to this comment long ago but thanks so much for the kind words and useful info chris very much appreciated kelsey said hi mike i m with a university outdoors club and we want to do some hiking in the area this saturday march st do you know if there is too much snow are trails open and would crampons be necessary thanks mike said hi kelsey your comment prompted me to update this page with a link to the mt washington state forest hq homepage the old page had become a broken link that i d deleted i ve never done this hike in the winter and am not sure of the trail conditions at the moment but would venture a guess that they are fairly gnarly even in warm weather this is a tough hike please give the park hq a call and see what advice they have for you there the number given on their homepage is hope that helps have a great trip and take lots of pictures tracy said my friend and i decided to take a hike up there yesterday around not really paying attention to the time or thinking about what time the sun would be setting thanks to your very detailed descriptions and spot on times we were able to navigate our way down after the sun had set thank you for providing beautiful pictures and a thorough description of what to look for the hike kicked our butts but was so worth it thanks again mike said so glad you made it down safely hope you have many more great adventures out there perhaps with slightly less excitement paul wimmer said hi we just hiked the trail today your website helped tremendously thank you we got down following the loop not sure exactly how but we did along the way down we encountered a ft timber rattler very cool well at least i thought so i have a question though at the top we came across a military ammo box my son and daughter were very intrigued by it there was definitely something inside of it but we chose not to open it just curious if you know anything about it it was pretty much out in the open thanks paul mike said hi paul hope this is helpful thanks for taking the time to comment mike jessica said mike said hi jessica that s a good question i got that number from my hiking gps which records all the ups and downs during the hike if you click the first link in the gps goodies section at the top of this page the one that says google terrain map you ll see an overlay of the elevation profile for this hike including the little upward jog between mile and that should account for a good percentage of that extra ft if you re using a mobile device to click that link you won t see the elevation profile it needs to be a regular laptop desktop browser hope that helps and i hope you and the scouts have a great trip kelly said do you have an address for the parking area at the start of the trail mike said hi kelly just the intersection i gave in the sorta nearby address for your gps section above which should work for putting into google maps or a gps device and will get you really close the directions to the trailhead section gives more details too there s a house right across the street but it seems weird for me to post private addresses to this site so i generally don t do it hope that helps let me know if you still can t find it have fun out there if you check this one out mike kimberly kilbride said on step four it says that if you go straight it s a dead end tonight we accidentally missed the turn off and went straight that way albeit probably longer is a gentle carriage way esque trail right to the top of the alander trail basically the blue trail is shorter but if you want to save your knees a bit for the descent you can head straight and end up there anyway either way the hike was amazing and your trail guide a usual was helpful in negotiating it mike said thanks kimberly that s good to know never tried that way and thanks for the kind words very

breakneck ridge hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley main menu home the hikes store faq leave no trace breakneck ridge it is extremely difficult though and i d be very hesitant to recommend this hike for small children i ve done most of the hikes in hike the hudson valley with a baby on my back but i d never attempt that here and i d only bring a dog that i could carry i didn t see any other dogs there that day but a fellow hiker assured me that she sees dogs here all the time there were several spots where my pooch memphis needed a boost and i honestly don t see how a dog would get over some of those spots without being picked up and placed on top of the rocks the point i m trying to make this hike is steep it is also gorgeous and unforgettable if you have a chance to pay a visit to breakneck ridge don t pass it up and if you don t have a chance you should probably make one anyway trail guide climb up and over the tunnel that runs over rt d following the white trail markers enjoy the view toward the river and try not to think too much about what s waiting behind you oops you thought about it didn t you oh well might as well start climbing again just keep following those white markers there are a few spots where you can choose steeper or less steep options which you ll see marked with an x pointing left and right see that guy on the cliff in the picture above he was heading down and when he popped out beside a rock to my left i was looking right he surprised me i realized that the trail was less steep the way he came down that guy saved me at least one dog carry keep climbing and the flagpole becomes a distant memory take some time to enjoy the next cliff overlook keep climbing and eventually this mountain will run out of bluffs to throw at you really it will when it feels like you re at the top and you can t see any more bluffs in front of you you re probably there you ll have traveled about a mile though it seems more like ten the next three miles on the loop fly by in comparison at the top above a couple of nice little pine trees enjoy the view and munch a granola bar or two if you packed em it wouldn t be a bad hike to just go straight back down the white trail from here that s really where the best views are most hikers like a good loop though so if that applies to you let s keep trekking also the rest of the loop doesn t require any dog carrying the thought of carrying my dog back down some of those white trail sections again was enough to keep us pressing forward in the small saddle after the last big bluff ignore the yellow trail as it departs to your right keep heading straight on the white trail you re looking for a turnoff on your left to the red trail after you pass one last small summit and a little marsh on your right the frogs were going nuts in there when we walked past in late march i thought we were coming upon a flock of turkeys also the internet tells me that i should have said a rafter of turkeys but somehow that seems like the only way to talk about turkeys and be pretentious at the same time the turnoff to the red trail is very tough to miss the only thing it s lacking is a flashing light and perhaps some sort of siren when you see it take a left follow the red trail aka the breakneck bypass down a much more gradual descent through the woods with occasional northerly views of sugarloaf and the river after minutes depending on how leisurely you re strolling the red trail dead ends into the wilkinson memorial trail marked in yellow take a left onto the yellow trail and keep following it downhill the yellow trail continues its gradual descent for minutes or so ending abruptly and dumping you unceremoniously onto route d which can be a pretty busy road normally i hate road hikes and don t consider a loop trail that has a large road section to be much of a loop but you can actually see the parking area from the dump out point so we ll let this one slide especially since it kept us from having to carry our dogs back down the mountain take a left onto route d and walk carefully on the well worn path beside it carefully cross the street once you get back to your car boom you did it congratulations on knocking out one of the toughest hikes in the area now find someone to show all your awesome pictures was this trail guide useful to you

breakneck ridge andrey said josh said did this hike today a wednesday while the parking lots filled up i got there early enough to avoid craziness hiking up and it appeared that most hikers either turned around at the flagpole or returned down the yellow undercliff trail before reaching the summit the signs at the trailhead don t lie this definitely is not a walk in the park but it s not particularly tiring as the immediate rock scrambles force you to set a slow pace a little over a mile from trailhead to summit and it s mostly rock scrambling i m a year old in decent shape and the loop took me hours including a stop at the flagpole and lunch at the summit hours of that was the ascent a few notes i d like to add mike said thanks so much for the helpful updates josh glad you had a great day out there and i ll second the plug for the avenza maps app just used it for the first time on a different hike and it is really great to know exactly where you are at all times michael a mook said hi normally we do the w r y path and it takes about hours if we want to go longer would we then do the w to blue white dont turn at the red and then come back down the yellow how much extra time do you think that will take mike said hi michael i ve never tried that route but it looks like a nice option if you re looking to do a longer hike w bw b y left from the map it looks to at least double the length of this hike but the terrain shouldn t be as gnarly once you ve gained the initial elevation my irresponsible shot in the dark guesstimate hours total or additional hours onto however long it takes you to do the w r y version let me know how close i got if you give it whirl michael k said i am planning to tackle this hike this sunday but looks like it will be raining on friday and saturday anyone know how the conditions would be after days of rain would it be safe enough to attempt thanks shirley maloney said selling hot dogs at the tunnel is great dollar bill said yesterday i rode metro north to cold spring and walked to the breakneck trail head kind of a long hoss but not that bad really and the views are nice along the way once through the tunnel i took the white trail past the cut off and turned right on the notch trail blue then the red trail and to another blue trail cornish and all the way back to stony point where i spent a last hour exploring there this is doable for people considering taking the train to cold spring you can walk to breakneck and forgo the cab i m a healthy years old and not even sore today and of course the views are multiple and spectacular and there s even a doozy after the cutoff you ll miss if you take the short version of the hike mary said thanks for description of the trail my yr old son wants to take some friends there so i wanted to check it out looks amazing bob warsak said t drake said first from a local thank you lots of us carry garbage bags as a matter of course especially on mondays it s depressing worse now is the proliferation of graffiti robust discussion locally but i seriously wish the parks department would step in tony said beautiful and challenging hike major gripe is heavy crowds severely eroded breakneck ridge and wilkenson memorial trails i hiked from breakneck to beacon back in on a holiday weekend and not seeing that many people along the way d wasn t lined up with cars when i finished my hike like you see today dave said go early and go often hiked breakneck today for the nd time this season and it was absolutely beautiful out the first time i hiked this trail i was with the lady and about other people who decided scrambling up the face of a mountain would be a good idea while the firt trip up was great having to wait for others to find their next move and also having to navigate around people who decided they wanted to stop and look out at the hudson before even reaching the flagpole was frustrating at the least i planned it better this time and got to the trail before am i was one of cars at the trail head when i arrived and did not see anyone else on the trail till the nd lookout it was absolutely beautiful the scramble is difficult there are parts where it is fairly easy but then there are parts where you will seriously hurt yourself if you lose footing or are scared to get your hands dirty on some mossy rock while my first trip here didn t feel as difficult as today i think part of that was that i subconsciously followed the people in front of me and was able to see where they grabbed and stepped since i was alone and there wasn t hardly any traffic i was able to take a few moments on a few of the payoffs to just sit down and look out at the hudson river it was also fun looking across the way at storm king thinking a few weeks ago i climbed that mountain and was looking back over here at breakneck the way down wasn t bad but it was a bit slippery since there had been some rain last night all in all i ended up seeing people and a dog at one of the most popular hiking spots in the hudson valley and was able to get in nearly miles and a nice rest on the payoff in and a half hours when i was walking back to my car the masses were finally starting to arrive and hit the trailhead it made me really happy that i got up early rather than sleeping in yuliya semenova said hello guys i like to check out the map before i get on the trail which state park should i be checking out the map for which includes this trail thank you a bunch mike said yuliya man keeping the links on this site current is tough especially when new york state switches its urls around every year or so just to keep me on my toes i ve fixed the links above so that you no longer need to know which park to select the links will take you right to a pdf trail map just like they used to do see the map link in step of the trail guide or in the related resources section hope that helps thanks for the alert mike richard said i d like to go for a day hike from nyc but i m without a car is it possible to come from grand central station to cold springs and get a taxi from there to the trail head otherwise is walking from cold springs train station to the trailhead the only other option thank you matthew said there is actually a stop at breakneck ridge a handful of times per day check the metronorth schedule to see the times my buddy and i took the train there hiked the trail and ended up in cold springs where we caught the metronorth back rick elezi said we went here yesterday with my staff thinking we were doing the other one thats rated so we werent full prepared had some friends too so we were in total one of my friends had a broken foot and had to do the whole thing with a stick it was hard but he is happy he did it we really enjoyed this hike and want to do it again with proper planning of course mook said we love your site how much longer does it take to keep going up the white until it runs into the yellow another words skip the bypass thanks again chase hostler said hey mike i noticed you said your friend got to the trailhead from the cold springs station is that an easy walk i m looking to do breakneck this friday but not sure that the breakneck station is open that day and looking for an alternative g said hi i walked from the station to the trailhead before i believe it s around a mile walk easy on the way there but horrible on the way back especially if it s hot but overall it s fine hope this helps mike said thanks for the info g chase as g said it would not be an easy walk possible yes but not easy my buddy cheated by having me pick him up and i drove us to the trailhead if uber isn t already in cold spring i m country folk so i have no idea seems like a ripe opportunity there you could probably make a living shuttling hikers from the cold spring station to the area s various trailheads i just checked google maps and g s estimate looks about right around miles from the train station to the breakneck trailhead good luck and enjoy however you get there chase said thanks guys i think i m going to try and find a cab or uber from the cs station thinking of doing the white ridge trail up and taking the blue notch trail back to either the red to blue or yellow trails back into cold spring for a rewarding beer and burger any suggestions of which of those two trails to take r or y any special sights i see ruins on the map intriguing chase said ceem said hi thanks again for your wonderful trail guides ive been to storm king lake minnewaska anthony s nose bull hill mt beacon bonticou crags and table rocks sam s point little stony point walkway over the hudson and croton gorge park all because of your very helpful guides ive been to breakneck as well but i wanted to know how do i find that old eerie tree i know its weird but id love to go visit breakneck ridge again just to see that tree hehe mike said that s quite a list ceem awesome that s really great to see glad the site has been useful for you as for the tree i assume we re talking about this one from the slideshow it was photo from that day and the photo in step above showing the turn onto the wilkinson memorial trail is given that i take about one photo every ten seconds out there i m guessing that old tree is somewhere very very close to the turnoff my buddy rob noticed it have to give him credit hope that helps you ll have to share your own pic after you find that tree ceem said oh my i feel terrible about not being specific about it and you had to go thru the slideshow i actually saw the picture of the tree recently on hike the hudson valley s facebook page but i couldn t find it anymore i have seen many others post that picture but no directions at all and i feel like i should go there too haha anyways attached is the photo of tree i was talking about no pressure though it might not actually be along the trail thank you mike said oh of course yes that tree is on sugarloaf right next to breakneck at the junction near the other not as cool spooky old tree instead of turning left to descend on the yellow wilkinson memorial trail you d turn right to ascend sugarloaf that old tree is a local landmark anyone who chooses to visit please treat it with respect i know you would do this ceem but i did accidentally share a photo of two people sitting in the tree on this site s facebook page i thought they were branches when i glanced at the otherwise stunning picture on my phone when i looked at a bigger screen and realized what was going on in that shot i deleted it from my facebook timeline which is probably why you can t find it there anymore that tree would surely not survive being treated like that for long and it would be a real loss if that thing came down hope that helps ceem said i know if that tree doesn t survive people like me might not have a chance to see it anymore and thank you for letting me know where it is i will visit it next week thanks again tami said which of those was your favorite dave said great site my wife and i have done anthony s nose storm king mountain and bull hill using this website this spring already also have done the major welch trail in bear mountain how much more difficult is breakneck than these i really want to do this and we re in great physical shape but don t want to underestimate thanks mike said dave that s awesome glad the site has been useful for you breakneck is comparable to the steepest parts of storm king i expect you guys won t have any issues but i gave this one a out of difficulty rating so people would take it seriously happy adventuring maloy said mike said hi maloy i parked right next to the tunnel i took a vacation day and did this hike on a weekday so there were spots available there the overflow parking is just a little further north not sure about the other trail you re mentioning i ll have to look for it next time sorry i can t be more help on this one rick said last did this hike years ago wife and none of my out of shape bffs are interested too bad spectacular views challenging climb and an hour outside nyc it is a scramble and at times will need all extremities to achieve solid hand foothold you don t need to do technical climbing for the harder non alternate route but you should be very experienced or at least go with someone who is so you can be leveraged ever upward light gloves are good idea plenty of water amazing number of folks going up with no fluid replacement the cardiovascular challenge will have you sweating at degrees f within minutes so bring lots of easily sheddable layers if you want to be dry on the level and descending part of the hike and the initial descent on the uneven red bypass trail in late fall covered by leaves can be particularly challenging a good collapsible pole would be valuable here and above all take your time start early enough you want to budget comfortably hrs for traditional loop white red yellow d loop unless you want to be the object of ridicule or worse by the cold spring fire and ambulance crew cold spring resident said city hikers please use common sense when taking a trip up here from brooklyn to hike this is an incredibly dangerous and difficult hike please bring proper boots proper gear and a map compass we love the visitors but tire of our fd and amulence corps volunteers having to go out on calls to find lost hikers every weekend justin said hey mike so i got in touch with chase at xcelerated adventures for my tour there was a group of of us and he was an awesome guide for this hike for people who are not seasoned hikers but want to do something challenging like this i think its super beneficial to do it with a guide chase was amazing i d highly recommend his company for these tours justin said amazing thanks so much justin said i want to do the hike with a few friends this weekend does anyone know of an individual or company that offers guided tours for breakneck ridge mike said the bottom of the page says that their guided tours of breakneck are closed until april seems like unfortunate timing might be worth reaching out to them anyway hope that helps jeff said mike thanks so much for putting this website together it has been extremely informative when planning hikes in and around the hudson valley i am looking at hiking breakneck ridge this weekend and we ll be taking the train from grand central i was thinking about starting at the breakneck ridge train station and ending in cold spring to take the train back from there in looking at the map we were thinking of taking the notch trail after the ruins and then taking the washburn trail down to little stony point to get some well deserved food in cold spring since we won t have a car we don t need to do the loop so thought about mixing it up have you done this version if so any idea of the distance and time on this trail much appreciated mike jeff mike said hi jeff i ve never done that route before but on the map it looks doable assuming you are in really good shape and up for climbing both breakneck ridge and bull hill from the ruins to the bull hill parking lot taking notch trail to washburn trail it s about miles going straight up and back down the mountain a tamer option would be to take the red trail brook trail from the ruins then down the blue trail cornish trail back to the parking lot which completely avoids climbing bull hill the good news is that you ve got options you can see how you re feeling at the ruins and decide whether to tackle bull hill or not sounds like a great day either way hope you enjoy it update my original comment misstated the elevation change and total distance the notch trail doesn t go over the summit of bull hill but it comes pretty close the total distance from the ruins to the parking lot would be just over three miles not four as i d originally said going brook red trail notch yellow washburn white sorry about that gabe said woot finally made it out to the hike and it was great a little nerve racking as we never rock scrambled before and we got a little frazzled at the end trying to follow the yellow train connected to fire tower lane beware a few trail markers are on downed trees and some sections near the small stream can get you lost will be making this trip again on a side note on the listing of trails would it be possible to add a list of hikes that can be reached without a car will be looking forward to go on more runs thank you gabe mike said gabe said gabe mary dewitt said my husband and i hiked this for the first time yesterday it is challenging but worth it the views are fantastic korin g said really hoping its nice tomorrow and i will be going on this trek so excited thank you for all the good reference points krista said tried this for the first time today this was probably the hardest trail i ve done to date but you really feel on top of the world once you finally finally reach the top thank you for noting the nice loop trail i was very happy to learn i would not have to navigate my way back down some of those really sheer rock faces i would definitely do this again pwchao said we finished this loop today and enjoyed it very much the views and rocks are spectacular we are years old and used alternative routes to reach the top we will go back to hike this loop again soon mike said that s fantastic hope i m still motoring up breakneck when i m too glad to hear you all enjoyed it mara said i was trying to give you a thumbs up not sure what happened kudos to you aaron said is the rock climbing described straight up a rock face or over boulders onto ledges leah said good news i took him there yesterday and he loved it as did i i even got him to say he would rather be there than six flags your guide was awesome and yes he managed the whole loop was an awesome family hike thanks for this awesome website mike said you just made my day thank you leah that s awesome to hear leah said i spent a year in israel doing some crazy hikes but always with a guide i was thinking that it was time to discover my home country and your site seens like an awesome place to start breakneck sound amazing from all i ve read online i m just a little apprehensive of the initial hour of rock scrambling that everyone discusses bec i plan on bringing my thirteen year old baby brother he is not a bad hiker he s done mohonk mountain and loved it any advice mike said hi leah if he s done mohonk i bet he ll be just fine at breakneck i saw some very young kids or years old on my last trek there and they seemed to be eating it up i doubt they did the whole loop but even the trip to the flagpole and back is rewarding hope you have a great trip and enjoy exploring the area daisy said are guides readily available at this site mike said tarajean said i m a bit scared of heights but fit and cautious bull hill wasn t a problem for me but walking a treeless outcropping while viewing the river below is going to be problematic thoughts mike said heights are kind of part of the package with breakneck but the trail doesn t force you to walk out to any cliff edges if you d prefer not to hope you enjoy it if you decide to check it out kiran mahale said one of my friends suggested the hiking place and i came across ur site blog after reading your site i was planning to do alone but both of my kids were crying while i was leaving so i took both of them for hiking while driving to the tunnel destination my thinking was if it is difficult as mentioned in couple of sites i would just visit near by view point but once i reached the place both girls were ready to roll yesterday i did hiking with my girls year year and we did mile loop w r y in hours we started at and my the time we reached ft it was but girls were still energetic the view is so beautiful up there i could not believe my year old kid did this couple of dogs were climbing with their owners and my year old just followed the dogs up hill your site helped me to understand where to see red and yellow trails and other alt routes elizabeth said hello i did the labyrinth at mohonk two years ago and loved it there s something so much more fun about rock scrambles vs hiking but i missed the lemon squeeze due to time constraints and pure inability to follow the right path i m looking at doing breakneck mohonk or something else in the area and my main goal is fun rock scrambling without dying the two mile walk just to get to the rock scramble at mohonk has me a little wary of mohonk how would you compare the two if my main goal is to climb on some rocks tracy said i ve done this hike many times the views are breath taking i ve always taken the yellow down if you take the yellow down and cross the bridge over a small creek and make a left not far up is an old dairy barn after exploring it for a few minutes i turn around and follow the road down you come across a cistern the last two times i ve passed it it was filled with huge frogs continue walking and you will come to the old cornish estate we were lucky enough to come across some locals who knew the history of the place and had some photos of what the house looked like before the fire it s a cool place to explore to get back out to d you follow the red trail bo bell said great writeup thanks just a note for dog owners i live in cold spring and do this trail with my dog often but she s a border collie and kinda crazy athletic she has no problem with this trail but other dogs may if your dog is lightweight agile and all over everything in the outdoors it will probably be ok if you have doubts best to leave them behind susan haller said the information that you provided was perfect i can t tell you how much my husband and i enjoyed the scramble up the first mile with your encouragement that the rest would be easier the hudson river valley is such a lovely place thank you sue edelstein said justin said could you tell me a way to get from breakneck to indian brook mike said hey justin i m afraid i don t know of an easy way to do it the trailheads are about three miles apart if you re up for that stroll i suppose it s possible but that s a pretty long road trek if anyone knows of a good cab service in cold spring please illuminate us peter said peter said inessa said this looks amazing what special skills equipment preparation is needed to attempt this hike can a couple who hasn t really hiked but occasionally trailruns complete this we are runners and are in reasonably good shape running k at least times a week can we do this with no special prep richerich said just good boots you take the white trail up easier staying to the left nice hike on white and you can always go to the right for a more difficult climb venture off trail for some abandoned building s nice hike we go on weekdays because it can get busy on weekends going next monday mike said sounds like you re in much better shape than me you should be good to go as richerich said just good footwear some water snacks and a healthy sense of caution should be all you need if you check it out have fun and if you go on one of these beautiful weekend days enjoy all the company jenna said i ve done this hike on numerous occasions absolutely love it i came across your website today when searching for other hikes in the area thanks for much for putting this all together its awesome mike said thanks so much joe said more than your average hike piles of slippery leaves dry grass etc careful esp coming down great vistas bring a snack and water and chill d north of tunnel near start witnessed a dog severely stuck by a vehicle just missed a kid min later another crash which my daughter saw i heard very dangerous combination of cars parked along the road traffic going too fast people crossing the street heads up mike said yikes i hope the dog and everyone else will be okay thanks for the reminder to be careful here richerich said i first did this hike years ago with my new bride and puppy more recently past years i ve done this hike in the spring and fall with at the time year old and his year old brother last time my year old daughter joined us looking forward to going again march april i really enjoyed your video and pictures mike said that s great that your kids were up to the challenge i hope mine will be when they re a little older too they re months and years right now so they ve got a little time yet hope you have some great hikes this year and thanks for the nice words christopher buck said hi there great article this may be a rhetorical question but if i m concerned about my dog can i just take the yellow wilkinson trail to the red trail to the top thanks chris mike said chris thanks and yes you can do that then you could just take the white breakneck trail downhill until it gets too dicey for your pooch you d still get some nice views from the top of the white trail that way but if you had to turn around and come back the way you came you d be missing out on the awesome views and clifftop perches that are farther down the white trail near the flagpole and immediately above it to me helping a dog up a steep patch is easier than helping her down so i prefer to come up the white trail that s all a long way of saying yes your alternate plan would be perfectly pooch safe but you might miss out on a view or two hope you and your dog enjoy the hike should be a beautiful time of year to visit mike christopher buck said thanks mike how about taking the alternate x trails on the white on the way up does that make it anymore dog friendly chris mike said chris a bit more it did save me one dog carry to try the other way at one of the xs but there s no way around hoisting the dog over certain sections my dog is forty pounds and it wasn t a huge issue but i can imagine that it could be for some dogs especially if their owners can t help give them a boost my friends black lab made it just fine but that dog also needed to be hoisted in a couple of spots i would think most healthy dogs should probably not have too much of an issue but it ll definitely be a team effort in places your

sam s point hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley main menu home the hikes store faq leave no trace sam s point then i took a few more steps out onto the wiley coyote style cliff that seems to exist solely to give you the best possible view of the falls and i understood that it wasn t an overstatement at all the falls drop feet to the bottom of what feels like your own private canyon this is indeed one of the earth s last great places without a doubt and we re lucky to have it right here in the hudson valley that being said the falls aren t always running full steam come here in late summer and you ll likely see a trickle with a similar gallon per minute rating to your favorite shower head but when they re going as they re likely to be in spring or early summer or after a good solid rain other times of year man i don t know a nicer spot in the hudson valley and maybe not in new york oh what the heck maybe not in the whole world there are also some fantastic ice caves to explore at sam s point you can feel a cool breeze blowing through the caves even on the hottest summer day there are some ladders on the trail through the caves so if you brought your dog i hope she can climb ladders or you ll need to give her a little help if you have a st bernard you could also explore some of the caves with your pooch and then turn around when you come to the ladders you d still get to explore a good bit of the caves that way because they stay so cold the ice caves are often impassible well into the spring it would be a bummer to get all the way down to the ice caves entrance to find them closed so if you re here in early spring or late fall check at the visitor s center at the trailhead to make sure they re open if you re looking for a moderate hike a mile stroll from the parking area to verkeerderkill falls and back would be my recommendation that s the hike i did on my first five visits here it s beautiful the whole way and not too steep optionally you could add a spur to the ice caves and another spur to lake maratanza but that would be a lot of hiking for one day i ve never done all three in one shot but in theory it should be pretty doable for hard core hikers in the trail guide below i ll give the hike as if you re just visiting verkeerderkill falls and coming straight back which is what i normally do here but i ll list optional steps with the extra mileage you d be tackling if you d like to visit the ice caves and lake maratanza as well i highly recommend visiting all three but depending on how much hiking you like to do at once you might be well advised to check them out in multiple visits you should note in your trail guide that there is very limited parking at sam s point and once the lot reaches its capacity they turn away hikers no parking on the road allowed if you don t get there early on weekends you re very likely to be turned away you should note in your trail guide that there is very limited parking at sam s point and once the lot reaches its capacity they turn away hikers no parking on the road allowed if you don t get there early on weekends you re very likely to be turned away you should note in your trail guide that there is very limited parking at sam s point and once the lot reaches its capacity they turn away hikers no parking on the road allowed if you don t get there early on weekends you re very likely to be turned away trail guide update june from the parking area head around the gate on the main trail shown as the loop road on the map almost immediately you ll have the choice to go left towards the huckleberry pickers shacks which are a historical curiosity but you needn t feel like you ve missed out on anything if you never pay them a visit especially if you ve seen a shack before or right towards sam s point we re going right follow the decrepit old road as it gains altitude and meanders through several switchbacks in just a few minutes you ll find yourself looking up at some very cool cliffs shooting up on your left the same ones you saw on your drive in at one point along the cliffs you ll see a giant rectangular slab of a rock on the ground in front of you look at the cliff directly above it and you can see the hole this rock left when it dislodged and fell i feel like i should have some sort of punchline here but i just like that rock for some reason as the road continues climbing some beautiful views complete with rocky viewing platforms open up to your right take a moment to enjoy them the road gains enough altitude that you re now even with the tops of the cliffs you were just walking under in a moment on your left the road opens up into what probably used to be a parking area if you took this left turn you d find yourself on a very short spur trail to sam s point a panoramic vista where apparently some guy named sam survived a jump off the cliffs after angering some native americans no word on whether sam deserved to get caught or not but it s a good story anyway i like to save sam s point for last as a grand finale before heading back to the car but there s no reason you couldn t scope it out now if you just can t stand to wait it s just a short walk over there go ahead if you can t control yourself i ll wait here once you either checked out sam s point or delayed your gratification for later continue straight on the loop road which is mercifully flat compared to the climb you just completed the bushes rise up on either side and you won t be able to see much to your right or left you re looking for your first right turn on the road that heads downhill towards the falls and the ice caves when you come to this road turn right off the loop road a very short distance after you turn off the loop road the verkeerderkill falls trail heads off to your left through the scrubby bushes this is your decision point continuing straight down the road takes you to the ice caves and adds miles roundtrip that doesn t sound like much but it is a rather steep and slow going miles going left takes you to the falls a mile roundtrip from this spot over very rocky terrain that generally slopes gently downhill toward the falls though the uphill return feels somewhat less gentle optional step visit the ice caves keep heading down the road which descends steeply for miles to the ice caves at the bottom of this road you ll see what must have once been the parking lot for the ice caves back when this was a commercial attraction a white trail takes you on a mile loop through the caves take the closest entrance and the loop will dump you back onto the far side of the parking lot later after you ve caved it up have fun exploring there s one spot one the white trail where you have to open a door and a light pops on in the cave unless a previous visitor already turned it on it feels like you just walked in on a surprise party for one of the seven dwarves there are also some nice views towards the end of the loop once you ve completed the loop and come back to the parking area slog back up the road miles to the spot where the verkeerderkill falls trail heads off to the right as you get closer to the falls you ll plunge into a magical little birch grove if i was a gnome this would be my hangout the closer you get to the falls the steeper the trail heads downhill and the bigger the trees get finally you ll arrive at a stream crossing just above the falls if the water is very very high you ll have to follow it upstream for a while to find a crossing this has only happened to me once after some serious serious rain usually it s just an easy hop and a skip to the other side where you can stop for a moment to strike a pose if you re so inclined on the far side of the creek the trail turns downstream and you ll see the sign informing you that you re now hanging out at one of the earth s last great places make your way to the cliff overlook on your right please be extremely careful here there are no guard rails and it s a long way down behold the falls and then try to tell someone this isn t one the earth s great places about the dumbest thing i ve ever seen a human being do was back in when my friend chunks ventured onto the rocks on top of the falls to get a cool picture for his online dating profile i m including the pictures here because chunks just sent them to me and he did after all risk death to have them taken as of this writing darwin thankfully hasn t caught up with chunks yet after you ve soaked in the view of the falls retrace your steps back up the verkeerderkill falls trail it wasn t this steep on the way down was it when the verkeerderkill falls trail dead ends into the road take a right to head back towards the loop road going left here would take you to the ice caves once you arrive back at the loop road you have another decision to make take a right and in about a quarter mile you ll see lake maratanza a very nice place to visit and perhaps let fido take a well deserved dip go left and you ll head back to sam s point and your car visiting lake maratanza is not a loop and it s about miles up and back you could make it a loop but it s a pretty boring slog with power lines and radio towers in your face most of the way better to make a visit to lake maratanza an up and back venture hang out beside the lake no human swimming allowed and enjoy the sunshine for a moment when you re done head back the way you came my last time here i took my friends all the way around the loop road and i regretted it there s not much to see after the lake besides the huckleberry pickers shacks which look exactly like you might expect tempting as it is to complete the entire loop road i recommend heading back toward sam s point which is much more scenic head back towards sam s point on the loop road taking a left onto the loop road if you re coming up on the road from verkeerderkill falls or the ice caves or heading straight on the loop road if you re coming from lake maratanza whether or not you stopped at sam s point on the way in take a stop there now across the old parking lot on your right if angry people are chasing you consider taking desperate measures otherwise just relax and enjoy the view after you ve taken a picture or two at sam s point follow your steps back down the road to your car once you get there try to think of a better way you could have spent ten dollars and if your device doesn t like cragsmoor as the town try it with pine bush instead one hiker reported that this worked better for her was this trail guide useful to you please leave a comment search hikethehudsonvalley com sam s point kim said we hiked this yesterday and there is no more door to open we were sad the spot where you say there s one spot one the white trail where you have to open a door and a light pops on in the cave laura said i went today and the trails were open except for the ice caves and the waterfall trails also the wall that is pictured at sams point is no longer there it s just open rocks deanna said does anybody know if the trail to the falls has reopened i went here last summer paid yup not for parking just to be told that the trail we wanted to take was closed off i know that some trails were open but not the one to the falls awosting falls wasn t too far off so we went there but i m hoping to try back here soon and don t want to take the hour and a half drive to find out the falls are still closed mike said she also confirmed that parking is still per car not sure what happened last summer with getting charged bummer hope this all helps looks like it s still a waiting game for the ice caves and falls deanna said hi mike thanks so much for all the information that s very helpful i ll be sure to look out for those trails reopening sonya terjanian said does anyone know if the trail has reopened thanks kristin said i just checked the site today and it seems to be open https parks ny gov parks details aspx amycs said it is not open the verkeerderkill falls trail remains closed as listed in the link posted and as well on the link this website has posted i spoke to park staff today at the visitor s center and they explained not only was that trail and surrounding area burned last summer it just so happens that the falls are on private property and the owners of that property have requested that no one access the falls it was also mentioned that it probably won t be reopened until next year mike said thanks for the update amy looks like the ice caves are open again along with the loop around lake maratanza and sam s point itself but we shouldn t be holding our breath for the verkeerderkill falls trail to reopen when i called about a month ago they sounded hopeful that it might reopen soon they were getting ready to do a new assessment then your information is more current and the assessment must not have gone as well as they d hoped sigh at least the official sam s point web site seems to be kept up to date we can just keep hitting refresh and hoping tony said i remember hiking the high point loop years ago and not seeing a soul until getting back to the lot did the same loop a few years back and was amazed to see the number of folks throughout my hike you re right about the results of sharing photos on social media i hope all the trails open up by this coming spring but i highly doubt that will happen michelle said is this kid friendly i d keep it to the shorter portion of the hike but as far as difficult and danger level is this okay for kids erica said michelle did you take your kids i m curious thinking of taking mine this weekend michelle said no unfortunately not yet when i wanted to go the trails i wanted to take were still closed due to the fire i think they still are but i could be wrong bodlodroid said erica said ok great thank you so much for your reply picked up trekking poles and going to give it a go it looks like most of the trails have reopened bodlodroid said be safe and pls post how it was when you get back paul hanley said according to the official ny state website for minnewaska sam s point some of sam s point area has re opened as of late may sam s point overlook and ice caves and corresponding roads trails are open verkeerderkill falls area and trail are closed check website for more specific info and closure map mike said mike said you may do well to plan your adventures elsewhere for the time being bodlodroid said thank you for saving me a few hours of my life i would have gone this sunday for nothing never could have imagined this a huge part of minnewaska state park was in blaze just called sam s point to confirm they are closed until further notice jim h said thanks again for highlighting a great hike in the region the ice caves were a lot of fun a tight fit in some spots but very cool no snow left in october just in time for a new batch i also got lucky that there was water flowing over the falls please keep up the good work mike said awesome thanks for the report jim you picked a perfect day for it linda said has anyone hiked to the falls lately wondering if it is worth going there so late in the summer looking to go this weekend aug thanks tim said linda we hiked to the falls for the st time earlier this summer even though the falls were not very active dry spring they was still very pretty however we found the hike to be a lot of work the trail is very rocky and you really can t look up for fear of tripping so you re head is always down watching your feet and missing the scenery we find the ice caves hike is a bit more leisurely and enjoyable linda said thanks for the feedback tim mike said looks like they re still going pretty good there i would generally expect the falls to be a trickle at this time of year but it looks like they might be doing better than that now despite the general lack of rain we ve had today s storms may have helped some too best of luck if you give it a go linda said mike thanks for the info it does look good better than i expected we ended up not going this weekend opted for some biking but its still on my list thanks so much for your website its an incredible resource that my friends and i use all the time enjoy nancy said wondering if anyone knows if the ice caves are now open looking to visit there in a couple of days thanks mike said the ice caves trail is open effective saturday june the ice caves trail contains ice flows water narrow crevices low rock ceilings darker areas ladders and boardwalks please use extra caution in all areas appropriate footwear must be worn due to difficult footing for additional information please contact the sam s point visitor center tim said check that rain not until weekend tim said mike thanks for the response i have friends in cragsmoor and they were evacuated yesterday so as of monday apparently cragsmoor is no longer safe either rain expected tomorrow so that may help george said any thoughts on what happened to the young officer up there yesterday was going to do that hike but got a late start and did bonticou crag instead pretty scary brianna said the ice caves trail was and is still closed there was no reason for this to have even have happened if they had stayed on the open trails it s a very sad accident but why were they on a closed trail mike said george brianna i hadn t heard about this until seeing your comments scary stuff indeed and a harsh reminder to obey signage when a trail is closed you can pretty much guarantee it s closed for good reason tim said i am concerned about the fires in the area the local news is not giving specific fire locations but it appears very widespread is sams point being affected mike said vinny said we hiked sam s point for the first time yesterday your trail guide was great the ice caves were closed as of the falls were running nicely the dwarf pine and birch tree fields on the way to the falls were magical the falls trail was dry with very few mud spots all easily avoided just a hint for early morning hikers like myself the paid parking lot does not open until a m there is no parking outside the gate i arrived at and took a chance by parking outside the gate i returned to my car at a m just before the sheriff started ticketing vehicles thanks for the great website michelle said is camping allowed on this trail by the way i love your website so much ashby said quick question do you think this trail is doable with a month old i have a backpack that she can sit in and is generally pretty happy i want to take her hiking this weekend but worry this might be a bit too much i ve active and hike pretty often thanks mike said hi ashby doable yes but the trail to the falls especially is very rocky and the footing can be tricky i d highly recommend using trekking poles if you give it a go they ll help you stay on your feet and avoid any mishaps good luck kathee said sam s point is open we went there today the ice caves trail is closed still lots of ice slush on the trails we didn t go further than sam s point because it started pouring so can t comment on the rest of the park mike said thanks for this very helpful comment kathee i just updated the trail guide accordingly hope you can see more of the sights next time brianna said was so excited as this is one of my favorite places made the drive up today but it was closed after calling the line the machine stated closed till further notice so i found on the website they re doing cliff renovations make sure you call before you head up if its any time soon luckily there are many other near by places mike said hi brianna so sorry to hear it is the overlook the only thing that s closed from the post on the website it looks like it overlook closed beginning monday november th and continuing until further notice access to the sam s point overlook will be closed due to cliff restoration we apologize for any inconvenience the overlook is awesome but to me the waterfall is the real money spot on this hike followed by the ice caves overlook and lake so it d still be worth a trip but if you can t get to any of that i d like to get the trail guide updated with a big fat warning not to waste your time thanks for any more light you can shed on this one and thank you for taking the time to let us know about the closure brianna said i couldn t even pull into the parking lot the gate was across saying closed so i wasn t able to get to any part of it i love the falls and the ice caves it s one of my favorite places to explore i also just found out there s a place that is almost the next road over from sams called bears hill nature preserve it looks like a simple little stroll just out to the same gunks ridge but haven t checked it out yet myself just thought i d through that one out there to for future adventures happy hiking mike said thanks for helping to keep other people from driving all the way out there just to be disappointed happy adventuring mike said iryna said is it worth going end of october or better wait till summer and go hiking somewhere else thanks ahead mike said it s always worth it at sam s point but the falls are likely to be a trickle this time of year the leaves would more than make up for it though enjoy if you pay a visit jessica rubin said hi mike i love this hike i ve done it a number of times along with the lemon squeeze at mohonk can you recommend any similar hikes in the area jessica mike said if you see one with a short description that looks like a winner you can click the thumbnail image of the hike to visit the full trail guide you ve already picked two of my favorites hope that helps you find some more amanda said i love it here i go at least once a month i bring my newfoundlands w my brother we love the hunks minmewaska included but sam s point is my favorite for an intense hike try the ice caves verkeerdekill falls continue to the high rock point i can t reember the name atm and come back around to the trail around the lake it should be to miles and take from hours depending on your speed the view is well worth the difficult climb will said just got back today april and we had a great time thanks for such a great trail description most of the snow had melted not enough to open up the ice caves but plenty for a roaring waterfall the walk around the long trail was wonderful it ll only get more scenic as the trees grow foliage and the critters settle in thanks again for your guide cee said hi i know this might be a silly question to ask but by any chance do you think it would be ok for not so experienced hikers to go during this season maybe this saturday with a possible snow we did breakneck ridge last spring plus mt taurus anthony s nose lake minnewaska during the summer and didn t die if that makes a legitimate reference we used your trail guides so thank you for that mike said hi cee not silly at all but it s gotta still be very snowy up there even with things starting to finally warm up a bit another hiker asked about climbing mt beacon in the winter and i think the response i gave him applies here too i m afraid i won t be much help on this one i ve never been up there in the snow before i can t promise that it d be safe beautiful most definitely but you ll have to prepare responsibly and make good decisions for yourself sorry to be lame but without knowing people s abilities and experience i m really hesitant to make blanket recommendations about hiking in potentially dangerous conditions whatever you decide to do and whenever you get there i hope you enjoy it and take lots of pictures note the dude i gave this advice went anyway and said it was one of the most amazing experience of his life but i d sure hate for someone to slide off a cliff because i told them it d be safe when i can t say for sure that it would be and the trail to the falls at sam s point is very rocky could be quite slick out there if you decide to go i hope it s a great experience liz said mark said just finished hiking this over the weekend have to say it was pretty amazing we started at am taking the left at the parking lot onto the loop road went to the viewing point of the lake off loop road indian rock up to the high point down to verkeerder falls the ice caves and the back to the parking lot finished up at p m didn t really read the map much until afterwards inititially i thought we were doing a mile hike but it seems in accordance to the map it was ish it got brutal towards the end went with a group of four dogs and i think we were all pretty beat up by the end but overall great time and would highly recommend taking a visit to this location juan said what a wonderful writeup after looking at a number of places this definitely stands out based on distance difficulty and reward i m planning on going this weekend can anyone comment on how busy it will be and what time parking will fill up by i m coming from nyc so it ll be around a hour drive for me what time should i get there to be safe jean said we hiked there last sunday we arrived around am and the parking lot had only about three cars in it when we got back around pm the parking lot was completely full with no spaces at all it was a beautiful hike enjoy juan said that s good to know jean thanks so much so excited for tomorrow mike said thank you jean and have a great trip out there tomorrow juan looks like a perfect day for it jean said we hiked both verkeerderkill falls and the ice caves today after reading about them on your site and it was awesome just wanted to say thanks for all of the detailed information and tips great site mike said when the water s high sometimes you don t have a choice but to dip your feet when you re trying to get to the falls that shouldn t be the case this time of year though lake maratanza step above or the stream just above the falls step should do the trick and the ice caves are cool pretty much all the time hope you have a great trip you picked a great hike to check out toni ann said hi i am not an experienced hiker but just climbed to the top of the kaaterskills falls in tannersville and now i want more i am thinking of visiting the falls and ice cave this upcoming weekend are there any places to cool off i don t mean swim but dip your feet at least just curious connie miller said wow your summary gives it great justice thanks mike said thank you connie irena said loved your description i was there years ago with wild earth adventure club but now want to go with a friend you made me so badly to come back beautiful pictures and very thorough directions i am going to use it as a guide tomorrow thank you for taking time to share your experience mike said thanks for the very kind words and that s awesome that you re using this guide i hope you have a great day out there ryan said this really is one of earth s last great places sam s point is awesome and the falls are gorgeous i went down to the ice caves and they were really cool both literally and figuratively didn t make to the lake my knees rebelled after the falls trail which i would say is not just very rocky in parts but just plain very rocky throughout i felt like i was getting a break if there five feet of the trail with no rocks maybe next time totally worth the ten bucks thanks for this site i use it all the time to find places to hike i almost always say that the last place i hiked is my new favorite place but sam s point is going to be hard to top mike said that s great news that you re getting some use out of this site really glad to hear it i also don t know why i ever used the phrase rocky in parts to describe the falls trail i took out the in parts part there that s better thank you and man i need to get back out here again sam s point really is tough to top christopher said we hiked here last sunday and you really don t have to wait long for some gorgeous views headed to the ice caves first one of the coolest places on this hike then took the trail to the falls a lot of that trail was flooded with ankle deep water due to the rainfall last week but it made the falls that much better when we got there with our wet feet wonderful place thanks again for the info mike said glad you had a good day out there and thanks for the heads up about the water on the trail too hope your wet feet have forgiven me for not calling that out in the trail guide it s now updated with a warning about the trail s less than

landscapers locksmiths movers painters plumbers van nostrand ave englewood nj i have bookmarked a ton of places since moving here that i want to hike at or experience and this one was close to where i live parking was simple no charge to get in not a ton of people this park was really nice they have plaques with information on each area and what type of habitat it is and what animals you can find in each section we hiked the trails just after it had rained and i brought all of my kids and and it did get muddy but they have wooden pieces across most of the muddy areas so it wasn't too bad we saw a baby deer we saw bullfrogs chipmunks and tons of birds my kids had a blast and this was fairly easy for them to hike without problems i want to come back with just my older son and stay longer def worth checking out being outside is always better than inside very nice getaway and you can easily go through all the trails in one day i was going it alone today so this place was a great choice because it's not so secluded and there were enough people on the trails to make me feel comfortable the hike was beautiful it is one long trail that connects water and trees so you get a little bit of both scenery the park is clean and dog friendly there are benches and people bbqing but there is a lot of room to move around so it's never overly crowded whenever i get a chance i am either on the hunt for a new restaurant going to the theatre or hiking flat rock brook is a far cry from some of the hikes that i've conquered but it is a beautiful escape minutes from fort lee nj offering nature lovers a chance to relax and detox from the everyday hustle and bustle the park offers seven clearly marked trails approximately miles in total with some hills and steps but mostly flat an slight inclines follow the trails to macfadden's wetlands and the mystery bridge to get beautiful views of snapping turtles painted turtles bullfrogs fish birds and deer oh did i mention that you'll find the largest population of chipmunks ever it's a great place for family fun with a wonderful playground nature center and picnic areas enjoy nice little park hidden in the englewood englewood cliffs fort lee area given the relatively small size of the park you will find yourself walking the same route most visits they have slowly been improving the trail quality and removing fallen trees branches over the years akiva r we went on a bunch of the trails and they were all great they were all well taken care of and even though we went right after heavy rain they weren't very muddy got to see a bunch of deer chipmunks and interesting birds the nature center building was also interesting with some turtles and other items of interest we went with children of various ages and there was something for everyone here after reading last child in the woods by richard louv i've been on more of a nature kick than normal growing up i basically lived outside now raising a little girl in nyc it seems this would be a challenge it's actually not we spend most of our days outside but finding babbling brooks and catching minnows is something we've been missing until yesterday flat rock brook nature center located in englewood nj is just a short drive over the george washington bridge it's a well maintained acre forest preserve with miles of trails a babbling brook filled with minnows and turtles and woods full of birds and chipmunks my boyfriend and i made this adventure with our year old daughter during a heat wave it ended up being the perfect reprieve from the heat and allowed us to be outdoors rather than chilling in the air conditioning with the tv like we are today it's easy to navigate to the main nature center where you can pick up trail maps use their bathrooms and learn more about the preserve this nature center feels like it's situated within a suburb but this area is actually part of the western slope of the palisades we ended up driving to a side parking area on jones road which allowed us to park just steps from the brook and playground where we spent most of our time this area also has bathrooms and trail maps where you can choose from miles of different self guided trails we enjoyed the crystal clear stream saw turtles various bird wildflowers and tons of chipmunks we also saw an egret and some other kind of bird catching fish from the brook right in front of us we spent most of our time trying to catch minnows and playing in the stream but we also enjoyed the playground which was fun and had an interesting ropes area we spent only a short time exploring the trails which i'd like to go back and hike further when a friend told me about flat rock i was excited to check it out it exceeded my expectations and i can't wait to return next time i want to explore some of the seven hiking paths which are mostly flat and easy to navigate this area is perfect for families it may not be challenging enough for the avid hiker but there is ample nature and wildlife to satisfy most anyone tips there are two parking areas the main nature center or a smaller one off jones road the jones road one takes you straight to the playground if you want to play in the brook and catch minnows bring a net bathing suit water shoes and a towel no dogs allowed there are picnic tables but no grills allowed no biking on the trails the water is crystal clear and the park is well maintained there are many educational and camp opportunities for all ages check out their site if interested in this this drive is about minutes of the gwb bring insect repellent for more family fun ideas check out www familyroadtraveled com i love this place so much i come here a lot as i am lucky enough to leave just a few minutes away the trails are nice the park is peaceful i love the stream and pond they sometimes have maps there but you don't really need them park is clean and naturally beautiful the nature center building is cute and informative also in the garden section they have a recycle area and injured birds and owls that have been saved josephine the big owl is beautiful highly recommend to go here its a nice getaway safe clean and peaceful get to see lots of beautiful deer families of deers at times gets a bit packed on weekends but not overly crowded i have never in my life so quickly fallen in love with a place as i have with flat rock brook i found this place on a whim while taking my customary sunday morning drive after work i work the graveyard shift having always seen it on my gps i made it a mission to find it and go on a quick hike i found it at the dead end of van nostrand ave in englewood a gravel pit parking area complete with a small gazebo picnic area next to the pond and small boardwalk with it's own aviary and garden and an actual nature center which was closed that may be used as a classroom for field trip students or perhaps as an educational museum style building i thought that this area was beautiful in itself so i couldn't wait to see the trails maps were available at the beginning of the trails and to prevent waste they ask that one map be taken per group the map consisted of the trails and different areas available throughout the park as well as park rules but i barely gave it a glance as i was off onto the red loop trail as quick as my feet could take me it's their longest trail approx mi but it's the one trail that intersects with all the other ones rugged terrain on most parts and narrow on others my quick hike instantly upgraded to a light workout which put a big smile on my face it's truly wonderful to find an actual hiking trail that can provide a bit of a challenge moreover the park for lack of a better title is filled with a variety of animals here and there i've never seen so many chipmunks either that or the same one was following me around perhaps my most astounding find though was the deer sighting two does on the very trail right in front of me just looked up at me as if they were saying hello to their neighbor and continued meandering into the flora and fauna nibbling here and there on a few leaves off of a low hanging branch i was in pure awe it's everything one could ask for out of a nature experience perhaps the only downside is that they don't allow dogs i know many a dog lover myself included that love walking trails with their doggy companions however after seeing how much animal activity there is in this park i'm starting to see the reason behind the rule even if i didn't it wouldn't be enough for me to give this place anything less than stars i cannot wait to go back this place is a beautiful blip of nature in the middle of suburbia i have driven past the picnic area section off jones road for years and i was always curious what the trails were like how far back they actually went i decided my run needed a change of scenery one day so i went exploring the flat rock brook nature center the first thing a passerby notices are the huge signs forbidding dogs this is actually brilliant there aren't maps of the trails readily available at the picnic area entrance of the park so i just let my legs do the work and i followed any trail maker on a whim thankfully i wasn't worried or distracted about the possibility of stepping in anything undesirable the first orange trail was a tiny loop which was a great warm up but i found myself back where i started pretty quickly then i looked at one of the stationary maps they are dirty and weathered and very difficult to read and saw that the red and white trails appeared to go all the way up so i decided to keep up the exploration i am glad i did the trails are well maintained but can be narrow at times i ran into several groups of school children as i was there during a sporadic sick day in the spring i eventually came to the actual nature center nestled towards the top of the park there was a building there with restrooms and what i would presume to be an educational indoor space and administrative offices it was a nice place to take a bathroom break and stretch in the sun overall this is a great spot for a morning walk or family hike or a first date i did not see any other runners and i know sometimes runners can be annoying for normal paced people nice place to hike but not too much to take in there were some wildlife like turtles there which was a plus i think there are a few trails about mile each it was very clean and trails were maintained well this is a great place to take a hike and enjoy nature i love these wonderful trails they're great for a small hike on a saturday or sunday this is an awesome place for an enthused hiker there are several beautiful paths that can be followed the entrance has a nice pond if you find an area with a actual large flat rock over looking a lake that is my favorite place to sit and hang out there i love it here and need to go back once it gets nice out great for kids it could be a little bigger but the environment is diverse and pretty different sized trails and various lakes and streams i in fact swam their in a deeper part of the stream when i was a child hahahha i recommend this place flat rock brook nature

trips having enough clothes to change into is helpful while washing or drying others an extra pair of socks can be used as mittens shorts for swimming and fording streams are also useful wet clothes

giant ledge and panther mountain hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley hike the hudson valley main menu home the hikes store faq leave no trace giant ledge and panther mountain on our first visit here many years ago my wife kara and i visited giant ledge on a saturday evening it was like woodstock up there beatles songs were playing on someone s boombox tents were pitched all over the place laughter and loud talking echoed through the woods awesome this place is a well kept secret it is not one step out onto that first ledge though and it s easy to see why this place draws crowds this hike is called giant ledge but there are actually five distinct ledges where you can walk out and have the whole world or at least a really large catskilly slice of the world open up before you it ll be a mile roundtrip if you just visit the first ledge and then return to your car if you go all the way to the fifth ledge it ll be a mile roundtrip the view from each ledge is awesome but they re pretty similar good to know that you have other options though in case you d like a ledge to yourself and some of them are occupied as they likely will be just keep heading down the trail and there ll be another ledge in a few minutes one more item of interest there are two large campsites right near the ledges clearly marked and tucked back into the woods i ll point them out in the trail guide below in case you d like to join the carnival up there one night if you do climb panther though you ll be rewarded with some pretty awesome views similar to giant ledge but with a little more of that i m on top of the world vibe i know i just told you not to climb panther then i told you how nice the view is up there still really the view on giant ledge is pretty much equally awesome and the hike to that point has some steep sections if i was bringing friends on this hike who weren t super crazy hiking goons i wouldn t even consider dragging them up panther too however big a hike you decide to tackle at giant ledge just be sure that you do come check it out besides taking in all the awesome views maybe you ll make some new friends up there then you can ask them to turn down their boomboxes trail guide from the parking area on county road see directions to the trailhead below turn to face uphill the trail starts just to the right of the guardrail directly uphill from the parking lot carefully cross the road go around the guardrail and hop across the little footbridge to begin your adventure notice the sign telling you that you only have miles left until giant ledge woo hoo you re already almost there kind of sign in at the register to make sure this trail gets credit for your visit you ll be following those yellow blazes for the next miles or so in just a moment cross a wooden footbridge that goes over a picturesque stream has anyone ever told you that this hike is easy they lied it is catskill easy but not regular world easy over the next miles you ll climb feet over often rocky terrain next stop junction with the blue blazed giant ledge panther mountain fox hollow trail it took me twenty minutes from the footbridge see you there did i mention this section is not easy just wanted to make sure we re clear on that point over the next miles you ll climb another feet on the blue trail enjoy you may also find some wet sections here where you ll have to hop around the puddles good thing you paid the extra twenty bucks for the gore tex shoes right right about minutes after the trail junction you may notice a side trail to a spring splitting off to your left just ignore it and keep heading straight unless you know you need water and you brought a purifier in that case you d probably want to check out the spring just past that campsite marker keep an eye out on your right for the first ledge hell ooo what a view if you can find a spot here to relax and soak in the view you might very well want to make this your final destination careful at the edge one step too far and this really will be your final destination like ever after you ve had time to enjoy the view if you decide you d like to head back now by all means do it you ve seen the view at giant ledge it s really only very slightly different from the next four ledges they all look out in the same direction from this first ledge it s miles down the blue trail to the fifth ledge with the others dotting the way in between if you want to add them all to your retinal collection if you head back now hope you enjoyed the trip retrace your steps back to your car the only junction you have to worry about is the right turn onto the yellow trail about halfway down be sure to eat some pizza tonight you ve earned it if you continue reading from here i ll assume you re tackling panther mountain too if you re doing that see you at the next step crazy person on to panther mountain did we finally ditch the giant ledge people man were they slowing us down or what just kidding giant ledge people i m just trying to make the panther people feel cool since they re about to burn at least calories to see basically the same view they re already looking at just kidding panther people you re going to be so glad you did this to climb panther keep heading straight along the blue trail passing all five ledges at giant ledge as well as the turnoff to the second dec campsite immediately after you pass the final ledge the blue trail drops feet in the saddle between giant ledge and the panther ascent i hate losing altitude just to have to gain it again too but until someone installs a zipline here this is what we ve got from the bottom of the saddle to the summit of panther you ll ascend feet over mile following the blue blazes the whole way about halfway into that climb you ll notice the forest change for the first time in my life i marked a spot on my hiking gps with the label smell just as the trail reaches about ft in altitude you can smell the difference as you enter the alpine forest at the top of panther everything just feels different cooler darker more remote that s worth the price of admission right there even without the very nice views you re approaching about minutes after entering the alpine forest you ll see a short little unmarked side trail to your right heading toward some big rocks carefully clamber on top of these rocks for your first panther views not bad right from that rock it s a flat miles to the summit of panther you ll pass some smaller views on the way there don t be fooled into turning around yet you ll know you re at the right spot when you reach a nice flat rock right beside the trail where you can sit and take in the wide open view before you there s not a ton of room right here so hopefully you left most of the crowds back at giant ledge it took me less than ten minutes to get here from the rock that we clambered up for our first panther view here s my best attempt at a panoramic stitch of the view retrace your steps back to your car take the blue trail back down panther back up the little saddle dude more uphill to giant ledge then turn right on the yellow trail for the last miles back to your car for the rest of the day ask everyone you meet what size ledge did you climb today then tell them how big yours was directions to the trailhead from the new york thruway i headed north from poughkeepsie new paltz take exit for the kingston rhinecliff bridge then head west away from the bridge on route get comfortable you ll stay on rt for another miles at big indian turn left onto county road oliverea road sometimes also marked as fire house road if you see the peekamoose restaurant and tap room on the left that s bad news you just missed the turn after turning onto county road in miles you ll come to a hairpin turn to the right heading up a large hill parking for giant ledge is on the huge shoulder on the right side of the road just before that hairpin turn a wooden sign on the shoulder marks the parking lot pull off onto the shoulder and get ready to begin your adventure you know you re at a classy hike when there s a porto potty in the parking lot feel free to hit that now too here s the address for the slide mountain forest house was this trail guide useful to you please leave a comment search hikethehudsonvalley com giant ledge and panther mountain katie said what an incredible hike my friends and i went around am on a tuesday so the trail was nice and quiet and we had the ledges all to ourselves one thing i cannot stress enough bring some form of bug repellent seems obvious enough but we spent our time up top hopping from ledge to ledge to avoid being swarmed not sure if we just manged to hit a particularly bad day we did go just after a few days of rain but we definitely could have planned for that a bit better also nearly stepped on a little snake on the way down the lil guy went on his way with no bother but just be sure to keep an eye on where you re walking all in all this hike more than deserves those cameras diane said thanks so much for the sharing the article and comments are awesome and super helpful we plan to have a day hike there this weekend but the description of hiking the parther mountain scared me a little bit since my husband and i are definitely not super crazy hiking goons i am a little hesitate about whether should we do the parther part how would you rank the difficulty if comparing the part of parther trail to cascade and porter trail and esther and whiteface trail in adk we finished in a august s weekend if the parther part is even difficult than that two we will definitely reconsider about hiking it this time thanks so much sienna emery said so i plan on hiking this mountain in a couple of days but was wondering does the easier trail still have the same views that these pictures are showing on this page mike said hi sienna if you don t climb panther mountain you ll still see everything up to and including step above enjoy the hike erika said thank you so much for this write up i just did this hike with my friend yesterday we are panther people lol and agree we found that final scramble up panther more than a little challenging and also the climb back up to the ledges on the way down but that final view from the top of the world really did make it worth it my favorite views that day were from the top of the large rock near the panther summit and that final small ledge it seems someone has taken the panther mountain summit marker so we were unsure we actually hit it until we came down and checked our maps and trail guides thanks for the awesome write up and confirmation that panther people are actually the coolest we thought so but you helped us be sure jeff kent said we camped in the area last summer but didn t manage to get any hiking in this year we did overlook mt and this here great big ledge sucker although we went on a tuesday the parking lot was already full we had to park below it in the grass let me first say that we did this as a family with my wife not a hiker my year old son plenty capable though not into it my year old son who was not at all interested and has ankle and weight issues he bailed just before the yellow blue split my older son and i went the distance also my year old daughter who played along but was more than happy to bail out with mom and her brother though the yellow section is less than a mile it s pretty dang rocky and has several steep sections it seemed long to me because we kept stopping the first mile of the blue trail is dead flat but towards the end there are a couple nasty steep sections with much larger rocks i d rate it higher than a especially if you have non hiker types with you maybe if i had gone solo i d feel different i plan to come back by myself in the fall and do panther plus one additional note a bridge on a few miles before you get to is under construction follow the detour and you end up on so no need to look fr the turn you re already there norm said hey there great trail description does anyone here know if there is an easy to find campsite at the beginning of this trail a few friends and i are planning to get up to this area in the evening camp overnight and then hit the trail first thing in the morning would be great if we didn t have to do too much routefinding hiking in the dark any thoughts appreciated norm mike said hope that helps enjoy it out there norm said thanks for the insight dave i think we re planning to keep going all the way to foxhollow then come back do you know if the blue blazes remain easy to follow on the north side of panther mountain thanks again norm tim said planning on taking a hike next week possibly nov how are the foliage this time of year dave said hey i went a few weeks ago and most of the leaves are down at this point however the views are still amazing mike said jay said okay so let meh ask you this do you think that giant ledge panther and wittenberg should be separated by point difficulty wise thanks for the compliment do like to liven things up whenever possible have a good day i enjoy your site mike said hi jay i clocked wittenberg as miles longer than panther with ft more ascent i gave wittenberg a for difficulty and panther a i could see the argument for knocking panther down to an since we d have to move to the spinal tap scale to make wittenberg more difficult but it really just felt more like a to me maybe it was climbing the saddle on the way back that did it which is all a long way of answering yes one point seems about right to me but i respect that others will have differing opinions jay said the hike up to panther is fairly easy the hardest part of the hike is to giants ledge for anyone who wants to know the truth mike said thanks for livening up the comments section jay dave said just did this hike today and i m really confused as to what mountain jay hiked below the portion of the hike from the giant ledges up to panther was definitely a tough climb and i felt like it had steeper areas than the way up to the ledges the hike to the ledges and back probably would have been too short for the amount of time it took to get out to this spot but luckily since it was late in the fall and a little cold we had the place pretty much to our selves until we started heading back from panther mt the trail is super easy to follow but challenging the saddle between the ledges and panther was fairly deep and you definitely paid for it on the way back the views were outstanding even though it was overcast the mountains in the background gave off a blue tint and were just stunning i definitely agree that heading all the way up to panther is worth it but it also makes this hike a out of difficulty mike said thanks so much dave i meant to respond to jay s comment when he left it i re read the trail guide at that time and still felt that it accurately depicted the hike as i remembered it and decided not to make any changes your comment seals the deal for me so glad you had a great day out there hope you enjoyed a well earned larger than usual dinner tonight nick said jay said i m certain your write up is incorrect concerning which sections are difficult the most difficult part of this hike is getting to giant ledge with the rocky sections you describe being the accurate part but panther is a relatively easier hike from giant ledge it s just that you re already tired out from the steep rock ascents associated with your initial trip up to giant ledge it s not a long distance to giant ledge but there are steep sections which make it more on the difficult side of moderate panther mountain has some steep sections as well but it s not as bad as the trip to giant ledge not sure why panther would be panther should be where as giant ledge should be for the steep rocky sections that might hinder some older or less fit folks jay said meaning once you get to giant ledge panther is a from giant ledge but your review makes it appear that panther has steeper rockier traverses than does giant ledge not true the initial trip up to giant ledge is more steep and rocky mike said hi jay dave s comment above just brought me back to your comment i d meant to respond when you left it apologies for not getting back here until now after reading this guide over again it s my opinion that it accurately depicts this hike to the best of my abilities you know given what they are i can see your point about the steep rocky sections in the beginning of the hike but to me doing a mile hike with some steep sections warrants a while tacking on an additional miles and vertical feet appropriately nudges that difficulty to a thanks for taking the time to post your thoughts here i want to encourage people to poke and prod at these guides to help them be as useful and accurate as possible happy adventuring mike jay said actually reviewing my post panther is more like from giants and giants ledge from the lot making the entire hike more like but really wittenberg would be more like a mike said jeff kent said if you happen to be a geology geek this may be of interest to you http hudsonvalleygeologist blogspot com panther mountain impact structure html jhat said i noticed you had a dog labbie with you on this hike how was it for him her i m looking for a good hike with my labbie in the catskills but from my experience many of the peaks have rock scrambles that present a challenge for dogs i haven t done giant ledge or panther before so any input on your dog s experience would be helpful thanks dusty said a friend and i did this most awesome trail a few weeks ago i love your humourous take on it had me chuckling while reading as i retraced every single rock and every little scramble up and down that blasted path absolutely incredible views from giant and panther proud to say i m a panther person we had a great time saw a lot of butterflies enjoying the views and had lunch on the rocks at panther s summit before heading down i love your idea of a zipline over the col yes that would be a great alternative i too hate losing altitude just to climb back up some of those rock scrambles were quite fun as well but oh my if that view wasn t worth every single step no matter what peaks i have climbed and what will be coming in the future this is definitely one of the best hikes i have done including my section hikes of the ny appalachian trail the stop at the spring is worth it too for some ice cold spring water on a hot day it was absolutely freezing and after some filtering with my sawyer mini to lose the potential cryptosporidium and giardia beasts the best water i ve had yet out in the woods catskillblogger i hope you re all healed up after your tumble definitely give this one another go when you feel ready to you won t regret it and as mike said a guaranteed better time the second go around hike safe catskillblogger said i attempted this hike this past weekend i wish i had read this first lol i m not an experienced hiker and only made it about halfway before i slipped and bashed my face into a rock and had to turn around and go back my only few of the day was the margaretville er mike said oh no so sorry that happened must have been a very scary experience on the plus side if you ever come back here you re pretty much guaranteed to have a better experience than you did the first time hope you re feeling better and all is well dawn said mike said dawn your comment cracked me up cracked me up eight months
